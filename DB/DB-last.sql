Giving, making, creating&#8230; Looking at the search results for  &#8220;Make WordPress&#8221; and &#8220;the firehose&#8221; of Make WordPress Slack where the #docs channel was having their weekly meeting, Dan and Ny look at the wide range of options there are for new contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><em>I would say you\'re contributing by learning. Like if you\'re, if you\'re learning in community, that\'s a step deeper in.</em></p><cite>Dan Knauss</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentoring and organizing Meetups is a topic that comes up again. That\'s where Ny feels she has been given the most and most enjoys giving back. However, there are barriers to getting people engaged with the WordPress project — and to work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan asks what needs to be done to reach younger people. Ny talks about the barriers from a BIPOC perspective, where sensitivity to history and personal stories matters. Dan relates that to an inner city gardening project he volunteered with that had an all-white leadership team.

A community of creativity, cooperation, and contribution</h1>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> [00:00:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good morning Ny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Good morning, Dan. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> All right. It\'s an earlier one than, than we usually do, but that\'s good. Start the day. Um, yeah, so I thought we could, we could talk about, um, contribution and contributors and, and what that means in the, in the word. community where, um, I don\'t know, you, we probably both have about the same level of outside in kind of experience with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, I\'m not the expert or anything, but, um, mm-hmm, , I could tell you what my, my experience is and how I\'m, I\'m looking at that. And some of the discussions that are going on about what it, what contribution means or could mean. And, um, Yeah, how\'s that sound? What\'s what\'s yours? What is it? What comes to mind when, when you hear that word in the [00:01:00] WordPress context?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, I guess, uh, the same it\'s, it\'s the same when I hear it in like, you know, outside in life contribution means giving back. It means helping, it means providing, um, and, uh, you know, it\'s the same in WordPress. So definitely down to talk about this today, and I\'m very interested to hear your thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it\'s I, I think it\'s, um, it\'s the core part of the, the project that is the oldest, um, feature of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The oldest foundations of it, that\'s very, very open source, very old, um, old part of open. As Matt has said in, in some talks, like give a penny, take a penny kind of, kind of ethic. Um, really kind of going back, I guess, to like Linux and the seventies [00:02:00] and early and earlier generation. And I wonder sometimes if like after millennials or so if, if that\'s things have changed a lot and that\'s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understood. There\'s kind of a, a reciprocity there. You use the software, it\'s free. It\'s open. Um, how are, how can you, the more you get engaged with it as a user, as a developer, um, someone maybe profiting from it. How, how do you give back and does that, does that just happen naturally through the relationships that arise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or not. And how do we move really? How do we move the, the project forward? And, um, I was just looking this morning. Like if you, if you, um, I was, I was just Googling make WordPress. So there\'s the whole make.wordpress.org, um, page where you get the list of all the core core teams and, um, [00:03:00] If you search for make WordPress, you get three ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, first for WP engines, WordPress page builder, wordpress.com WordPress page builder element, or for WordPress, create it with Elementor, um, the create and build language. So, uh, most people these days, um, and, and they\'re targeting what people wanna do. Uh, how do you just make something with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create and build. But I\'m looking for the old school. How do I contribute back? Where, where the you\'re budding developer designer, just helping, like helping out. We\'re always looking for people to help make WordPress even better. Um, and there, what you can give back goes into all these teams that, uh, we now have a performance team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hasn\'t changed a ton. It\'s, it\'s rare for them to add. So we got the core and that\'s really like the fundamental. Thing here, if we don\'t move word breast core [00:04:00] forward, how much does anything else matter? But there\'s so much else people can give and do that really is essential too. You don\'t don\'t want to deemphasize that design mobile mobile team is now been more explicitly defined as that\'s open source that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not, um, that\'s not something that is tied to jet pack or.com. And you, you wanna work on iOS and Android apps, Java objective C swift. Um, that\'s a, that\'s a whole nother section accessibility. Polyglots multilingual, uh, translation, WordPress support, uh, support forums. What,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> uh, what stands out to you the most out of all of those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, what do you think? Like, not what\'s most important, but, um, cuz that\'s subjective. Um, which one would you be like most interested in contributing to? Yeah. Which one do you think speaks to you the most? When you read through the list? [00:05:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And I was, I was, I\'ve been thinking about that. So then there\'s documentation and that\'s where I\'ve been trying to kind of learn, figure out how to get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s, that\'s kind of where it, it isn\'t that easy. It isn\'t that easy. maybe, you know, some people or if you have a deeper connection, but from that straight outside in it\'s it\'s tricky documentation, themes, plugins, community. Training test TV marketing, CLI WordPress CLI the VP CLI uh, hosting tide, open verse photos for performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s really a lot of different skill sets that could be attractive. And a lot of things you could do, but to be honest, the, um, my, my experience is, um, I haven\'t really done like. Contribution in the form of little patches and bug reports and stuff since way back, like, you know, they\'re still using tra have you, do you have much SVN experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that\'s what we were all using like 20 years [00:06:00] ago on source project. WordPress is still using. Um, so, so yeah, there\'s all these, all these different teams that are maybe attractive to different skill sets you may have or different people, um, May have, and, um, core is really at the center of it. And there\'s all, all these other things orbiting around that, um, or orbiting around the community and, and serving it or around mobile app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and yeah, finding your way into it, I think is, is. Is the trick. Um, once someone gets interested in, in doing that and bringing, bringing new folks in and smoothing the onboarding, um, is probably, um, something we need to pay more attention to. It\'s tough. I, Brian mm-hmm Brian cords was, was writing about [00:07:00] that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did he, um, So he, he talks about his experience. I\'m, I\'m kind of doing the same thing. Try, can I put in a few hours a week, I\'ve been trying to follow, just look at the docs program, you know, cause writing, editing that\'s mm-hmm, , that\'s probably the easiest thing for me. I\'ve I\'ve done little bug reports and patches and, and things before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I go back a long way. So SVN or, you know, was something I was using way before GitHub existed get was a thing. Um, but it\'s, it\'s. It\'s quite amazed of, of things and a lot of customs and etiquettes and rituals, parts of the culture to, to understand, um, to get started. So I feel like there\'s like a long watching, reading, learning, asking questions, maybe getting mentored, um, phase you have to go through, um, have you taken a look at like the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would make [00:08:00] WordPress slack at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have not. And I\'m going to be completely honest. Um, I will eventually, I am just in so many slack channels right now. I don\'t think I can. I don\'t think I can possibly take on that one. Um, I\'ve heard it\'s it\'s a lot. I, I just cannot do it. I\'m in like work slacks. I have like my mentoring slacks that I do official mentoring with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have like slacks I was in before I, um, got. Um, tech and I still help people there. I just, uh, if I join one more, I think my head will explode. Yeah. But please enlighten me to what usually goes on</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> here. Well, I\'m not an expert, I\'m trying to figure out the same as you and, and, and Brian and, um, yeah, I think the reality is, is yet they call it the fire hose for reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, it\'s probably, one of the busiest slacks and consistently for so long, this major, um, Of [00:09:00] information and cooperation. Um, so it\'s daunting, it\'s intimidating to, um, to look at how to get into, um, but it there\'s there\'s method to the madness and what I\'ve learned, just kind of following along and looking at, at things in a, in a pretty traditional way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I assume the. Other teams work like this, but like docs. Um, we have a, um, a meeting every Tuesday morning at this time. So 8, 8, 8 am. I\'m kind of following, um, on my phone here and people kind of check in. I can make it, I can\'t make it. Um, melanic cap is, um, one, the leader there and one of the leaders and you\'d probably like her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'s a ump developer. Um, who\'s kind an advocate. For PHP as well. Who\'s been doing docs for a long time. So you developer literacy is really important if you\'re gonna write [00:10:00] docs and guides for, for things that directly deal with that. But there\'s so much else you don\'t have to be. You don\'t have to have any particular code depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s so much other documentation going on. Um, and that\'s probably starting to overlap some with the training materials that are another team. That\'s a. Newer thing that will help onboard people, I think, to have training and then also mentoring happening all these meetups that are relatively new, um, community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Is that I\'m not sure what group that\'s what if that\'s happening under the community team? I think that\'s all that\'s under the training team. Mm-hmm uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> what the meetups,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> oh, that you\'re talking about. Yeah. They\'re make they\'re they\'re coming out of the core. So they\'re, there are, um, Hannah tab. For this somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Organizing the meetups, which is what I\'m doing in [00:11:00] Columbia, South Carolina. And I always say the city and not the state and Charlotte, North Carolina, mm-hmm um, falls more under community. We\'ve been all over there. Yeah. Trying to get things, uh, settled for it. Um, that\'s that\'s my area of export.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expertise, but it\'s still really, really hard. Um, , I I\'ve, I\'ve organized a lot of things and this might be the hardest honestly. And I don\'t know if, if it\'s, you know, because it\'s so specialized or what, but, um, still really excited. And I just I\'m, I just can\'t wait to, you know, have that set up as my contribution and like spread it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s like my goal for it. Yeah. That</p>\n\n\n\n<p>would</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Def that would be under, under community. Um, Yeah, it\'s actually is I guess, something you could get into and start doing in your own, um, in your own city and a lot happens outside of slack, outside of, um, Outside of this, but that there\'s the community team. And mm-hmm</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was, I was speaking of, um, the, the newer meetups that [00:12:00] are sponsored by learn, um, WordPress. So there\'s, there\'s probably some increasing overlap between community and training, which is a good thing. There, there are all these meetups that are happening as virtual. Um, there\'s a schedule, there\'s a calendar on here where people like, um, um, People who are directly involved in working on Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, uh, Nick Diego, I saw I had had one coming up, um, uh, will be doing live workshops so you can go and get, get some knowledge from, from people who are directly working on, um, on newer parts of, of WordPress and. so some of that is higher, higher level stuff for, um, developers, designers, and some of it is oriented towards people who might be really new to using WordPress in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So training\'s [00:13:00] close to mentoring and close to community building. So that\'s kind of a neat area where, um, where people can. Brought in and, um, connected. And I would say you\'re contributing by learning. Like if you\'re, if you\'re learning in community, , that\'s like step in mm-hmm um, for a lot of people, um, I noticed that, so we have this weekly thing that Daniel Chut Smith is doing, um, for us where he\'s rounding up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, What\'s going on and what\'s catching his eye, uh, design and development. And this, his last Roundup was mostly stuff coming from.org from make, create your first app with Gutenberg data. So using react. Um, so Adams Linsky put together a nice tutorial. That\'s showing you how to do that. That\'s a link to, um, developer, the developer section of word, wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block theme builders, Figma [00:14:00] of building a workflow from Figma Figma to your block theme. You\'re trying to create, that\'s a learn WordPress online workshop. So that\'s, that\'s one of these things I\'m talking about. That\'s a meet up. So, um, you can sign up and, and do that. There that\'s an intermediate level for an audience of builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people who may not be high, um, Deep into code, um, high level development stuff. That\'s okay. This is, um, working from Figma to your block template. Are you, are you doing anything, any front end stuff like that, or mostly have these database backend projects you\'re working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'m doing everything. But, um, mostly right now I am working with the database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mostly when I talk to my mentors and they want me to show them, like, I always get the question. Uh, can you show me what you do at work or a day in the life of you? Mm-hmm and, um, I don\'t show them my [00:15:00] calendar. I don\'t wanna scare them away, but, um, uh, usually it\'s front end work with them, um, because that\'s what, you know, they learn first and most are interested in, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, I have not gotten away from front end work because that\'s the first thing that newbies wanna see. Oh yeah. How it works in WordPress. And I think, uh, WordPress is great for front end development. So that\'s my way of trying to get them into the community as well. So I throw in my community stuff like, Hey, you know, we\'re gonna have meet up soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to come and learn more about the community and that\'s my sales pitch. And that\'s how I, that\'s how I get. That\'s how I\'m getting people into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It\'s great to see that there\'s so many levels like, yeah, we\'re gonna reach out to builders, to people who are totally new to it, to people are maybe doing freelance or agency work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I was hinting earlier, like when you, if you search for this, like the way that, the way that a lot of companies, including, um, wordpress.com and automatic or. [00:16:00] Presenting WordPress to the world is to the creator economy and to, to people, I just wanna build something. I wanna start my business online. I, and, and their first thought is I don\'t not to understand anything about open source or that there\'s a community behind that or what, that, that, there\'s this, uh, culture of contribution and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a long, that\'s a long way up later. Mm-hmm and , I wrote something where I, I, I feel like, you know, we really have. Embrace that. And I see that happening on the marketing level, on the commercial side to a lot of WordPress companies. Um, and I, I even noticed like, as, as the.com, um, I, when they did their first price change, I got the bargain and I up upgraded my longstanding account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a.blog blog and a bunch of other sites there. And. Um, you can, there\'s the marketplace there. You can install and do a lot in.com. Now you can install Elementor I\'ve not seen that [00:17:00] before. So you could, you could pop that in on wordpress.com and start building with that if you want. And they\'re very oriented towards a, a builder, um, creator economy approach, but getting people inside is like the key thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, however you come, however you come, come, as you are. I think like that needs to be more of. Our approach. And as cuz people aren\'t gonna, the average person, isn\'t gonna go to.org, the make thing there, and look at these core teams and, and, and go like, okay. Yeah. I, I see where I fit. Like I, you and I would, would struggle with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like it\'s gonna, it\'s gonna take weeks and, and months to probably get, um, to get comfortable. And that\'s, that\'s cool. That\'s fine. That\'s how you build relationships, but it\'s not. It\'s not like on the instant gratification level of, let me build my site today, which you wanna do as quickly as as you can. Um, [00:18:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I think it\'s even, um, even for people like me who will sit down and take their time, um, when things are presented to them, It\'s so much to go through sometimes depending on what you want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And like you said, like it\'s not an easy thing to jump into. It\'s it\'s making that time too. I know, like for me right now, I get asked every week, like, how are you doing everything you do? And sometimes, I don\'t know, but, um, like. I think it\'s easier for me to still contribute because like, I, I didn\'t go into this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, Hey, I have to make myself fit to one of these. I went into this as, this is what I already do. This is something I\'m good at, how can I connect this with WordPress? So I think that\'s an easier way. And then like that allowed me to like, okay, I can make time to, you know, set this. I have a partner helping me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Ken, yeah. Elliot is helping, um, well, he\'s the mastermind. I\'m helping him. Um, and, um, I think that\'s a easier way, but I agree with you a hundred percent. [00:19:00] Um, that\'s, you know, just when you were reading them off, I\'m like, this is a lot. And then when you get into them, it\'s like, you have to break it down and that\'s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think if we have like more. I guess people like me or you cuz you did it too. When you talked about how, you know, you\'re a writer and documentation probably would be your strongest point and you\'ve done some of it before. I think people getting people like us to talk to people and say, well, this is how we did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would definitely help people a lot because it\'s a little overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It, it is. And yeah. Well, if what I, what I found is that it\'s probably your own sense of, um, my own sense of in, in, uh, you don\'t want to be ask of the dumb question, but, or, you know, You have to put yourself out there. So they\'re very encouraging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like who\'s got questions who needs help. You know, you, you, people will take the time and, and show you. And I\'ve, I\'ve got like an accumulated list of tabs and, and links where I need to, I need to take some time and watch this UN WordPress TV. Right. I need to read through this and figure it out. [00:20:00] I, um, a couple weeks ago, I, you know, figured out how they\'re using good Gutenberg on, um, GitHub, a little deeper and, and how to, um, How to submit, um, changes on, uh, there\'s there\'s documentation, that\'s written into code, uh, in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and sometimes it\'s wrong or, or changes. So you have to, you have to actually commit, um, changes to comments that are embedded in PHP code somewhere. Um, Things like that there\'s a wide range of, of stuff, but how all these workflows and things work and it just takes some time to, to learn. And it\'s, it\'s pretty satisfying once you figure it out and you are like, okay, I fixed, I fixed that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, it definitely</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> is. Yeah. And in the process you might find some more bugs or things and stuff like that to, to put in. Um, but just a little here and there is, is, um, is really a good thing. [00:21:00] Um, I, I. People on the whole are, are really welcoming. It is, it is just getting past that fire hose and here, here\'s what I need to forget all that other stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s what I need to focus on. And it\'s probably cool doing the meetups or mentoring, which, um, is gonna become more and more a part of the training and community. I, um, I don\'t have, I\'d like to get more details on this, but I, I see SFA has been, been saying things about mentoring as. Becoming a more explicit form of contribution, mentoring, how to do word camps and, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And mm-hmm , and that they, there is probably some mentoring program coming down the line, along with training. So if you\'re doing, you want to go and do, um, a meetup, um, tutorial of some kind or do that in the context of your own meetups, totally contributing. And then I that\'s, that\'s probably accessible to a lot of people cuz most of the work is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gonna be, I would assume relationships and [00:22:00] stuff like in your community. So you don\'t like, you don\'t start from slack, you don\'t start from, from all that. That\'s kind of where you go to maybe get support. And, um, the main, the main thing is really the people stuff. So if that\'s, that\'s what turns you on and, and motivates you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, that\'s totally essential contributing out there in. Real life relationships, um, locally where you\'re, you\'re starting. How\'s that going with? Um, Greenville and, um, or green wait, Greensboro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> no, not Greenville. Um, not Greensboro. Um, I think you\'re, you\'re getting me nice or green mixed up with those I\'m I\'m joking. Um, so char Charlotte and Columbia. Okay. I don\'t know where Columbia .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Go ahead. Sorry. I used Greenville in my head like Greenville, South Carolina, you know, I used to live [00:23:00] in Raleigh mm-hmm Durham, chapel hill area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually. I don\'t know if you know that area that well, Carrie and Carrie and table mm-hmm . Yeah. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, I, I really love that area actually. Um, uh, you, uh, now there was a, uh, Greenville, uh, WordPress meetup for a long time. Um, and I think like a lot of people in Columbia, even though there was one in Columbia at one point, I think a lot of people in Columbia had to go to Greenville for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you may be thinking about that. Cuz Greenville, I think had a longer, a one that lasted longer than ours. In Columbia. Um, but we\'re right now, if we were to start one in Columbia, to my knowledge, cuz I always check out Greenville, Columbia, Charleston, the big major cities, to my knowledge, we would be the only one in the state right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m gonna double check on that. But the last I checked a few months ago. Yeah, we would be the only one. So I. It definitely would help. And like, we really want to spread the knowledge because Columbia\'s in the, in the middle of the state. Right. That\'s why I chose Columbia, not just because I [00:24:00] was from there, but it\'s in the middle of the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm, , we\'re an hour and a half to almost anywhere in the state, maybe two max. And so if people have to make that drive, which, you know, if they can, that\'s fine. If they can, we still wanna do it, uh, in a way that will. You know, semi virtual and recording recorded. So we\'re setting that up as well. Um, cuz we know South Carolina is very rural and we don\'t have great public transportation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, it\'s really going to help a lot because it\'s going to reach all throughout our state, which is not known for tech at all, Charleston and Greenville, more Southern Columbia. So. It\'s going to help a lot and it\'s going really, really well. Um, we have a place, um, we have food, uh, so many different companies reached out to me because they saw what I was doing and wanted to help goad wants to feed us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, my company master WP wants to feed us and master WP is actually sponsoring our, um, sponsoring us and taking care of our venue. Um, we [00:25:00] have people offering to send us. Things to give out to newbies. Um, I have Courtney Robertson, which is, she\'s been such a great help who has just offered to give out so many learning materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, I ju just the outpouring of support and then we can take that and spread it. It\'s just been, it\'s been a community effort, so it definitely meetups are definitely community. I see why it\'s under that label and I\'m just so excited. Like I\'m going to like spam everyone\'s Twitter when. You know, get up and running and we have pictures and video and things like that because, um, I think, you know, I agree with Josepha Josepha is really, really great to talk to, and I love how she answers questions and it\'s always very transparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, it\'s, it\'s awesome that she\'s going to expand that because we can definitely take these materials and, you know, help with that and make sure people can do it in their states. Maybe their states don\'t have any work camp meetups or WordPress meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. There\'s probably, uh, It\'d be interesting to look at a, a Pinboard, you know, [00:26:00] map of, you know, where we, where there\'s activity and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some are very established and been around a long time. Some come and go. The, I know the local Edmonton one. Um, yeah, pretty much ended just around the time I, I moved here. There\'s one in there\'s, one in Calgary. Um, and I\'ve talked with some people there about, about all that. Um, you know, it, it\'s a, it\'s a takes a lot to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get things, uh, rolling again, but there\'s wherever you go, there\'s kind of an existing WordPress builder community. I, I, I sense there\'s a lot of people freelancing or, and there\'s a bunch of agencies and my, this was true even when, before WordPress was that adopted probably at that level. And I was doing more with, um, with June law and some other DRAL and other, other CMS, um, related things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That a lot of people just get in to scratch their rich and build something. And, and then they [00:27:00] start doing that as a job and maybe they develop an agency or something. And so there\'s, there\'s a bunch of people who are like an unorganized, the lump and proletariat of word press, who are like, uh, they\'re not organized into, um, into a, a regular meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly. Um, but the potential is there mm-hmm , maybe it comes in and goes at at times, cuz there there\'re people who would fit the kind of WordPress professional or the line between the hazy line amateur and, and professional and doing this for myself and or which often turns into this is my job. Um, but it\'s, it\'s often secondary and I think that\'s an, that\'s been tough for the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project. And I wonder if there\'s, if there\'s a, that\'s kind of where contributor language gets gets complicated. And I wonder if we should like focus more on creativity and creation and there\'s all these people who are sort of [00:28:00] on the outer edges, who, who are very versed, inward press or using it in some significant way, but they haven\'t really connected deeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Into the community. And they\'re definitely contributing in the sense of, um, teaching and informing and expanding the market and expanding the brand, but, um, how they find their way into. These other, um, layers of the onion towards core contribution. Um, it\'s, it\'s tough cause you don\'t wanna make it sound like, well, what you\'re doing isn\'t worth as much mm-hmm um, cause it it\'s as they\'re all different, but to drive things forward, you do need people to come in who get more of that kinda leadership level to organize, meet up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentor people, um, submit patches, um, get involved in, [00:29:00] in actual software development, which yeah. Is hard not to, not to privilege. Cause that\'s really a key, that\'s what we\'re all using. That\'s what either falls behind or, or innovates and yeah. What do, what do you think about that? Do you, are you think there\'s ways in our language that can be kind of offputting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it\'s like this inner circle of, of people who give back and are. Are you adequate is it can maybe be an easy feeling of, uh, of inadequacy or imposter syndrome that\'s RI and, and things, and, and that language can kinda land heavily on, on you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, yeah, definitely. Um, especially, you know, that\'s something that goes beyond tech, but, um, when we\'re talking specifically about us right here. Yeah. That can be off putting you. You have to think. Um, I do a lot of community service. because that\'s just how I am. That\'s just how I was raised. That\'s just me as a person, but I\'m smart enough also to acknowledge [00:30:00] it\'s tough to get people to work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it\'s tough. Um, that\'s something that\'s drilled that was drilled into my head from, um, From a young age. And we talked a little bit about that on one of our other podcasts, like how American slavery, like is affecting people to this day. And it\'s like, there\'s no way anybody in my family from the oldest members, my great aunts to the youngest, my little baby niece, none of them would just sit and smile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I told them I was working, doing anything for free outside of C. Help. So , and it\'s like, it doesn\'t even have to be that deep for a lot of people. People are just not working for free mm-hmm, , we\'re in a very capitalist society. Um, we, things cost money. You know, things are high right now. Um, but again, not even getting that deep, it\'s just hard for some people to just work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also for people who want to do it time. Time is such a big constraint. So you may have people that are out there. They\'re like, I wanna do this. Yeah. But I [00:31:00] don\'t know how I wanna do this. And I don\'t have the time. And now these people are telling me that I\'m not enough. If I\'m not doing this, man, I\'m not doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, I, I see how it can lead there. Um, I, I, I definitely see that. Um, sometimes, you know, I, I it\'s, it, it is, it does seem like that at times, but it\'s just going to depend on you as a person, like stuff like that. Won\'t bother me personally, because if I can\'t do something, I can\'t do it. Yeah. I don\'t have the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t have the time, but I, I get it. I definitely get it. Um, I, I\'m not sure though how. I\'m not sure how to pull people in, who may be feeling that like it, they may have that imposter syndrome now. Um, is there just like extra reassurance? What do you think? What, what do you think could be clarified in the language to get those, to, to kind of pull those people back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I think that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> the more channels, the more way, ways in the, the better off you are, if it, I feel like in the past, it\'s [00:32:00] like, that\'s the only thing, like.org make page. You either figure out how to get into a team here, you hit the support forum. You, you, you find you come in through some local group. Um, there are only a couple, couple ways to do it and it, uh, it is all in this open source contribution code, committing focus, and that\'s become less and less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that was alwa that\'s always, always been a subculture and it\'s become probably more and more of one. um, I think younger generations too, are in a totally different space in because it\'s social, um, realities, like, I don\'t know how much we\'ve really addressed that. I mean, there are long term prolonged economic contraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, not everyone\'s doing that. Mm-hmm well, emotionally. With stable income and employment. Mm-hmm [00:33:00] you can\'t assume stuff like that there, it we\'ve been through the most stressful. Yeah. I, I don\'t know if we\'re really through it, you know, like you turn on the news and it people all around the world. And even in, in places that are, are fairly affluent it\'s, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot more stress and tension in, in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people have lost, uh, friends and loved ones either, you know? They\'re no longer living. Um, that happens normally, but we just pandemic. Um, there\'s but there\'s so many, especially as you have a community to ages and, and goes along. I, I think a lot of us who\'ve been in there a long time. Um, there\'s time of life things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, I, it would be more sensitive to that all. And, and what you\'re saying too about. there\'s cultural and, and definitely racial differences that I think are hard to see from the outside. You\'re making me think of, um, mm-hmm, how the, a [00:34:00] good metaphor for this is when I, one of the things I did, I did a ton of, I lived in a part of Milwaukee that was, um, and otherwise it\'s very second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe people would say an apartheid city that has some. Entrenched in difficult problems and living in one of really the only area that\'s, that\'s fairly mixed and, and diverse is volunteerism is a key thing there. And it\'s tough. People don\'t have necessarily have a bunch, but there\'s this huge. They don\'t necessarily have the means or whatever, but they.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s just such a drive to do community projects together and fix stuff. And gardening became more and more community gardens and stuff like that. Victory gardens. Yeah. Well, when I first started doing that, I was, um, I was doing it with, uh, uh, a church that had an interesting history. And so we had mostly African American kids coming to the summer program and, and trying to make a.[00:35:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots of vacant lots where stuff has been torn down or burned down over the years and in my neighborhood there. And, um, trying to build a, make a garden and, um, this same, it, it it\'s, it wasn\'t so much the work for free, cuz we, it was all hitched up to, um, You you come and you work on this, you get paid a certain kind of gift allowance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we like try to explain banking and like walk down the street to the, the local bank on Martin Luther king drive. And like, this is how money works and like save a little. And , uh, give a little back and, and think about what your long term plans are for what you want to get. It was, it was honestly very white, middle class kind of skiing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>very good in very good intentions, but the first barrier is, um, these are kids who have like zero, um, [00:36:00] there in that area. Um, Their, their experience is all urban for, um, probably one or two generations. But before that down the Mississippi deep south, not a good agricultural experience share, you know, share cropping, you know, extended forms of Neo slavery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, you know, until grandparents, parents came up in the fifties, forties, fifties, and got the last of the good industrial jobs before that all went, went in part. Um, so, mm. I realized and read some things. Um, I never read something. I can\'t remember who it was, but there was a, there was a local guy and then someone else rare, uh, voices of African Americans who got on the land and were farming got, you know, as free farmers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people came all the way up here in Alberta and did that Canada. And it\'s not the typical voice. And they talked about how hard it is to do. [00:37:00] Things like with the land, from an African American perspective, cuz there\'s such an alienation from it some of the time. And so these kids, oh yeah, they would not wear, like they didn\'t have grungy clothes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would wear like their best white brand new shoes. Like, you know, they didn\'t want to get messed up. It was really hard to get people like, get your hands down in, in this. And then like, remember kids would say like, you all look like a bunch of slaves. Like this is a huge barrier. Here cuz there\'s not an ability to imagine us working and doing this free labor in any other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And like who\'s in charge, the white guys like, like, yeah, it totally looks, it totally looks that way. So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> um, yeah. Yeah. It that\'s a good, that is a good way to put that. Sorry, that that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> really story. Cause you can express that in a way that is accusatory. and make, you know, make us feel really bad, but, um, but it\'s totally valid and, and [00:38:00] there was a disconnect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the only way I found around that was like individual relationships and getting like over a couple years and getting to know some of these kids is they were growing up and like they in doing other things with them, like I found a, a bunch of the young men, um, like they never went over to east side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s dangerous. You can\'t go over there and there\'s nothing there that we would be interested in and, you know, broadening people\'s sense of their own freedom and capacity. Yeah, you actually, we can go over here. There\'s some cool stuff and food you like and, um, people who, uh, are friendly. So it, I think that kind of everyone does that everyone has their little comfort zone that probably needs to be expand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the same time, those walls exist, cuz people have been hurt or they\'ve, um, or there\'s something in their history where they see this as a wall that is defended and is dangerous to push [00:39:00] or they, they sense on some level like this is gonna, um, this isn\'t what I should, this isn\'t for me, this isn\'t my people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s just huge that\'s people stuff. We have to find, find ways to make many ways through and in. Um, cuz if you keep trying something that doesn\'t work, that turns people off, it doesn\'t matter how right. You think you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah, you\'re right on the money with that. And. just relating that back to WordPress. Imagine those kids that you were, uh, you know, trying to get to do that with. And they\'re like, God, like not saying, this is their attitude, but say they walked away with that saying mm-hmm they were trying to get us to do free labor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were trying to get us do free work. That\'s crazy. And then they. um, they, you know, they get older and they learn code and they learn tech. And they\'ve heard that tech is just this, this freedom and it\'s this place to make money. And it\'s just like, you can elevate, I can elevate my life and they get to tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the first thing they see is people saying, Hey, if you wanna be a [00:40:00] great person in this community, you need to do some free work. They all like what? Like they might freak out like what in the world? Why is everybody want me to do free, free labor and, um, that\'s, you know, that\'s just relating that back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s it\'s sometimes that\'s. A red flag to people. It\'s definitely a red flag to me. Um, because also people are still exploiting people of color women. Um, people who are disabled, they are still getting exploited for low wages or free labor to this day. So that\'s still something we have to look out for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve been asked to do free labor many times, and I\'ve had to politely tell people like, no, I\'m not doing that. Or, you know, and depending on. What the situation is, maybe talk to others, like what\'s going on. Like I have to teach my mentors not to accept like, well, this job, they really gonna gimme the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said, okay, me an exposure and experience. And then one day I\'ll be a big developer. No. Do not let people do that to you. That\'s like, I, I always tell people like, no, [00:41:00] you, you deserve to be paid. Now you deserve to be paid fair and adequately. So we don\'t have to go back too far. It\'s happening today. Um, so of course people are calling it out more and people are looking at it as a red flag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate that people see it as a red flag in WordPress. Uh, some people. Inmate WordPress and giving back. And then I hate that some people just, you know, don\'t have the time and they\'re turned off by, you know, phrasing about it because it\'s, it\'s a privilege to have free time. Honestly, these days, isn\'t it, it\'s a privilege to be able to give back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s something I never forget. And that\'s, that\'s something I always tell people as well, like, you know, you don\'t have to. You don\'t have to thank me. Like people are always like, oh, thank you for this like that. I don\'t, you know, you don\'t have to thank me. I, I acknowledge that, you know, it\'s just a privilege for me to be able to do this for you and that throws some people off, but Hey, it knows what it is, but we, I don\'t know how to bridge that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially as a, as a woman of color, who\'s been asked to do free things as a woman, as a woman of color, as a [00:42:00] person of color. I get it. I get it. I definitely</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> get. I, I, I was really glad when I, I think it was Josepha my first contact with hearing someone say that it\'s a privilege to contribute. Um, and I hadn\'t really thought about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that does that\'s good language, I think, because it, it gives honor to that role and that capacity, but it also understands that that might not be. An individual is at, at that time, then I think you have to extend yourself and go further and, and look at who is underprivileged or who lacks these privileges and how can we raise them up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we open doors? Um, and that that\'s, what\'s cool about the mentoring and, and the community stuff. Cause I think that\'s, that\'s what it does, you know, get it will help. It will help. There are other ways to, to give back and. [00:43:00] And it\'s, it can take years it\'s years of relationships and, and growth where, um, that that\'s what\'s needed to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can\'t, you can\'t what we\'re saying here. You can\'t just treat people like cogs. Like they\'re not all in the same category. They\'re not the same time of life and they\'re not the same people. And when you really know, get to know them, um, they\'ve unique gifts and capacities and what they\'re okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. With doing. um, at the moment and it\'s okay for everyone to say, and they, they, they need to, like, I need to, I need to step back. I need, um, I think we\'ve been, there\'s been so much more, um, recognition of that. Um, mm-hmm , uh, someone was tweeting the other day of like, they\'re just too much coming at. \'em too much stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re gonna, they\'re gonna give their, um, word camp ticket to someone else. And. Step back from going there. And, um, and a lot of people are [00:44:00] really supportive of that. Like, yeah, it\'s tough. Uh, tough call maybe, but, um, it\'s okay to it\'s okay to say, you know, I I\'ve hit my limit here. Um, mm-hmm .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That. Yeah, I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m gonna backtrack. I think that that\'s a great way. That would be a, a big help to helping people letting them know it\'s okay. That needs to be more clear if you can\'t do this right now. It\'s okay. Like you said, like, you know, Joseph said it\'s a privilege and you know, letting these people know, like, um, that doesn\'t mean you\'re not privileged if you can\'t do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that\'s just not your time and that\'s, and that\'s completely okay. Right. And I, I like that. I like that a lot. And I, I really like that. I think also another big thing. We need to get people to see the value mm-hmm and giving back. Because again, like what\'s the value. If I can\'t make money, if I have to like take time out of my life where I\'m missing with my family or my friends, what\'s the, what value do I have to, some people like, just knowing it\'s going to [00:45:00] improve the life of someone else is not enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it\'s okay though. It\'s okay. Um, but how do we get people to see the value in this? I think community seeing people like me, who, you know, I could not, I could stop giving back tomorrow and be okay and go do other things with my life. But I don\'t wanna do that. I like giving back. It\'s valuable to. . I have a lot of things I value about giving back, especially in this community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I stand up there and I talk about it and I tell people and I give to them, honestly, I think that\'s the number one thing I\'ve seen in my life that makes other people wanna give. If they can see the value that other people are getting, that isn\'t tangible, nobody\'s handing me money to do any of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so I think being a, a beacon of that helps, and I think I wish we had more people, but it\'s, it\'s hard if you\'re, if you\'re doing all of this and you\'re giving your time away, it\'s hard to be like, you know, the poster job for that as well. Um, right. We a lot of people have families. I don\'t know what I would do if I had children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I would probably just [00:46:00] scrap \'em to my chest. One of those little baby vests. I like those. Yeah. I used to do that in front of you. Yeah. Oh, I love those. I would just scrap \'em to my chest and like, I guess we</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> around and talk. I\'m glad to be through that kind of, um, yeah, my, my younger two daughters are, um, on finishing high school now, so it\'s pretty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s on their own, but, uh, yeah, that was, that was tough. That was interesting. I was the home parent. Um, and at one point, yeah, they were like, mm-hmm um, four girls they were mostly there with me and yeah, the two close together. Um, yeah. It\'s uh, well freelancing and doing neighborhood projects. It, it was, um, it was a lot and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And mm-hmm it makes you, it makes you sensitive. the fact that you need to, you need to understand people in their context and so that, like you don\'t mm-hmm so you can kind of help on your end too. You don\'t ask too much or that, you know, you know, how to, [00:47:00] how to phrase, um, you know what they\'re, they\'re just some conditions like you understand like, oh, this is, isn\'t a good, this isn\'t a good time or a good person to, to ask to, to help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or. Or maybe they need, you know, just knowing what the needs are and where you can be supportive to. Um, yeah, just the, the more you get deeper into individual relationships, I think the stronger and more, um, sensitive like community is the, like those go together, the strong and sensitive . Cause you\'re, you\'re aware of each other as individuals and, um, that holds things nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that made me, I was one. The last thing I, I was thinking while you were saying that there, there are so many, I think there are so many things people do or don\'t do that. Some things need to not be done. that, that contribute so [00:48:00] much. And we know it and, and sometimes it there\'s other forms of recognition that are important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like yeah. If the, if WordPress cord doesn\'t move forward, everything else fails. And there\'s like, there\'s a level. um, mm-hmm of focus and need on that, that that is is unique, but then there\'s stuff that\'s farfield from maybe any, any teams that is so important in the ecosystem. And, um, uh, a guy, everyone I think has nothing but prays for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin O Hashi who, um, who like Kevin O Hashi, who does the, um, uh, WordPress benchmarks? WooCommerce too. Have you ever looked at those? Uh, there\'s kind of neutral third party deep, um, uh, analysis each year of, um, performance on load testing and, and a bunch of other stuff of, of hosts. Who, who, um, partner with them who say like, yeah, here here\'s our, here\'s a free account [00:49:00] and all of our tiers test them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, never go through those and, and see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have, um, I have, did I do last year? I have, I have, I I\'m like, I\'m just going back in my mind, but I have, and I think that is really, really, really awesome. That does that. I\'m so sorry. I hear</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> from people a lot about, about that. Like that\'s a, that\'s a major service because there there\'s a lot of data poverty in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your plugin isn\'t in the re.org repo, like what do we know? What, what, what do you, what do we know about that whole, um, part of the market? And if you are in it, it\'s very limited. What, what data you get out, um, hosting, you know, going way back has always been. A pretty murky place for are these real reviews?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, Jen . Oh man. So this is like the [00:50:00] one he\'s got the one, um, the one shining beacon of reliable, trustworthy stuff. And as, uh, And he, the contribution is largely in what he doesn\'t do, which is take money or sponsors in. Um, I, I forget what is, what the, what the revenue model there is, but this is, this is one guy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, this isn\'t some growth oper organization. Um, it, those are really difficult things. The things we need to subsidize or help that, um, are. Kind of have a regulatory effect that help protect the space and the commons, um, because they don\'t aim at massive growth and they aim at a giving you a really honest signal on, um, you know, how are, how are these hosts doing one, one compared to another, what do you get for this, [00:51:00] this price point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And. They, um, it\'s good for them. They, they know where they stand and how they\'re, how they\'re doing. I\'m sure they have their own data, but it\'s a huge incentive to, um, to compete where we want them to . Um, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot of different things like that. There\'s just certain personalities who give back a ton on, um, social media or in, um, their willingness to, to teach others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but. Yeah, I don\'t know. Do we recognize that openly enough? Um, and I think people doing stuff for the love of it is a huge privilege and it really, it is really is gratifying when people say thank you. So, um, we should do that more and thank you for starting meetups. Interesting. coming on this, on this podcast and, and being a, um, a unique voice in the, in the C.[00:52:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Uh, you\'re so welcome.

Uh, yeah. I don\'t know nothing by Madonna. I remember bad memories of a friend at a, um, student union at Marquette university who, uh, crazy guy. I don\'t think he had even been drinking, but he did, um, Papa don\'t preach and acted it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, he ended up playing down on a table or something and yeah. Yeah. He was having a, having his baby. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> oh, now I gotta do [00:53:00] Madonna. I gotta show him up. okay. No Madonna just make me a list of no, the nose.

But I\'d say the <a href=\"https://investors.digitalocean.com/news/news-details/2022/DigitalOcean-to-Acquire-Cloudways/default.aspx\">number-filled announcement to investors</a> (and <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/619704647/files/doc_downloads/2022/DigitalOcean-Cloudways-Acquisition-Infographic.pdf\">infographic</a>) from <strong>DigitalOcean</strong> makes it clear they know they are buying into the WordPress ecosystem by acquiring <strong>Cloudways</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The acquisition of Cloudways expands DigitalOcean’s serviceable market within global SMBs and increases options for <strong>digital agencies, eCommerce sites, bloggers, freelance developers and builders hosting on WordPress</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Magento</strong>. WordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) and, according to <strong>W3Techs</strong>, it powers 43% of all websites on the internet.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>DigitalOcean sees itself expanding to gain small-to-mid-sized businesses (SMBs) in its customer demographic, and acquiring Cloudways with its WordPress and other open source eCommerce customers achieves that. </li><li>There\'s no easy button within DigitalOcean itself for setting up a WordPress site or anything else, but their 1-click apps are the latest progression toward something like that. It\'s just not likely to appeal to most people in the low-end market <a href=\"https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/wordpress?utm_campaign=amer_brand_kw_en_cpc&utm_adgroup=digitalocean_wordpress_bmm&_keyword=digitalocean%20wordpress&_device=c&_adposition=&utm_content=conversion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5yYBhAjEiwAKXk_eCTLbvWw706hdVQiD8CFN5sup_3G_RMowCw_QPCtG5icj3v7gGg7ORoC4ukQAvD_BwE\">in its current state</a>. DigitalOcean marketing is still locked onto startups and developers too. I imagine all this will change if Cloudways is brought in as a SMB customer-facing easy-button.</li><li>Focusing on less-technical end users and the people who build their sites will put DigitalOcean in direct competition with other hosting panel middleware like <strong>ServerPilot</strong> and <strong>SpinupWP</strong>. (In its early years, Serverpilot quickly turned its main focus to being a way to &#8220;<a href=\"https://serverpilot.io/\">Host WordPress on Digital Ocean</a>.&#8221;)</li><li>Build/Builder language shows up a lot in DigitalOcean\'s messaging. This sounds a lot like WordPress\'s mission updated for the era of (increasingly low/no-code) website builders (software and people) — &#8220;DigitalOcean simplifies cloud computing so builders can spend more time creating software that changes the world.&#8221;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some interesting numbers from DigitalOcean:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>DigitalOcean and Cloudways have been close partners since 2014.</li><li>Cloudways has approximately 50% of its customers on DigitalOcean servers.</li><li>This acquisition increases DigitalOcean\'s high spend customers by 18%. They will come away from the deal with a total of 124,000+ (new and existing) customers paying $50+ per month, which is  84% of DigitalOcean\'s total revenue.</li><li>Cloudways is projected to contribute between $13 and $15 million of revenue to DigitalOcean\'s bottom line in the remaining months of FY2022 after the deal closes in September.</li></ul>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status</a> • <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status - The Community for WordPress Professionals</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 19:53:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"Post Status: WordPress.com has changed a lot\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106686\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-com-has-changed-a-lot/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2346:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-is-managed-wordpress-hosting-and-has-been-all-a-long\">This is managed WordPress hosting — and has been all a long</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve been delinquent with posting on my .blog blog on WordPress.com for about a year, so when I bought into the Pro plan after the first recent price change the new stuff really stood out. (I\'m also pleased I upgraded then, because after they reverted to the  original price structure I realized I\'m getting every feature of the old and new Business plan at about half the current price, although the storage is much lower.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve dug in a little more since then and it\'s clearly the best WP.com so far. Apart from some demo P2s I\'ve never had much going on there. I have a second work account for &#8220;self-hosted&#8221; sites that use Jetpack, and it\'s still annoying to switch between them and manage subscriptions to comments and posts. (You can only be longed into one .com identity at a time.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most surprising thing to see develop over the last six months or so is access to hundreds (currently 886) premium plugins — including Elementor and the Classic Editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven\'t explored how I\'d go about adding &#8220;third party code&#8221; and installing any of the 50,000+ plugins in the .org repo, but that\'s allowed on my &#8220;Pro&#8221; plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see it would be relatively easy to set up a Substack-like site at WP.com because I know the plugins, but for the average user they\'d really have to dig into some docs and do the work. What\'s badly needed are something like &#8220;blueprints&#8221; for instantly installing typical configurations of plugins and themes for a common use-case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several years ago I mapped out how I would strip down WordPress and turn it into a Substack-like membership site that used wp_mail / php_mail properly to see if I could get good deliverability with 100+ subscribers.

She notes:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The open-source community is aware of its security problem. In fact, the community is already attempting to build out institutions and standards to secure open source. For example, the Open Source Security Foundation, or <a href=\"https://openssf.org/\">OpenSSF</a>, has already met with the White House twice and has 10 dedicated workstreams all focused on securing the open-source ecosystem. Companies like Microsoft and Google, large open-source contributors, have pledged <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/16/white-house-open-source-security/\">$30 million</a> to support OpenSSF’s efforts. The <a href=\"https://ostif.org/\">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a> (OSTIF) was founded recently to provide free security auditing services to open-source projects and continues to grow.<br /><br /><em>However, on its own, the open-source community does not have the leverage to demand the resources and minimum security practices required. To preserve its core ethos as a free service and commodity, the open-source community cannot impose conditional requirements on its projects. As a collaborative of many volunteer developers, it also struggles to impose requirements on its own contributors.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder if that is really true and open source self-regulation is truly impossible. Sharma uses developer pushback as an example, in the case of the <strong>Python Package Index</strong> (PyPI) imposing &#8220;minimum security measures on &#8216;critical\' projects.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her argument is that open source needs help and governments should pitch in because open source software is “critical infrastructure.” This is not a new idea:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Several nations have adopted regulations that recognize open-source projects as significant public assets and central to their most important systems and services. <a href=\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/germany-launch-sovereign-tech-fund-secure-digital-infrastructure\">Germany</a> wants to treat open-source software as a public good and launched a sovereign tech fund to support open-source projects “just as much as bridges and roads,” and not just when a bridge collapses.

This includes smaller related items like the shim for non-supporting browsers and adding PDF  support, which are being handled in separate tickets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal to generate WebP images by default for new JPEG image uploads has been controversial from the beginning. While the Google-sponsored contributors driving the project have made some revisions after an initial round of significant critical feedback, other contributors have continued to voice concerns that they said were not being considered. Several contributors reported issues with the feature and suggested that it should start by being opt-in, an idea that was summarily dismissed before the main work was committed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, WordPress lead developer Andrew Ozz weighed in on the ticket with <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:112\">new objections</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/MatthiasReinholz\">@MatthiasReinholz</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eatingrules\">@eatingrules</a>, and others I think this approach is perhaps lacking. Why would there be twice as many image files taking up a lot of extra space when half of them will never ever be used anywhere?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IMHO a better approach would be to just make all image sub-sizes WEBP. If JPEGs are indeed needed, these can be generated on-the-fly as needed. There is no point of clogging the web servers storage with all these useless files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if the WEBP file sizes are actually larger than the JPEGs, that would probably mean that better tools are needed, and this patch is premature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Six weeks ago, in response to one complaint that the &#8220;resources for conversion would be tremendous,&#8221; Google-sponsored core committer Adam Silverstein confirmed that resources for generating the images on upload would &#8220;increase dramatically.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However resources to serve an image will be lowered,&#8221; Silverstein said. &#8220;Since image uploading is very rare compared to image serving, the extra effort to compress and store images should be worth it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another problem Ozz cited in his objection to this approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Actually that dramatic increase of resources usage when uploading an image is a very bad side effect here,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;It means a lot of uploads will fail, and leave the users stranded. It also will increase support requests for both WordPress and the hosting companies dramatically. Don&#8217;t think this is acceptable. Because of this, even if image multi-mime support is needed in WordPress, the current approach doesn&#8217;t seem like a good solution.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately 24 hours later, Google-sponsored contributor Felix Arntz <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:114\">commented</a> to advise that the WebP fallback mechanism to JPEG for older browsers was ready for commit and that he planned to commit it in a few days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Please do not commit any more code here unless it is to address the dramatic increase of resources needed to create image sub-sizes after upload,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;As I said above such increase is unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Is there any data about how much more resources (memory, processing time, etc.) are needed when uploading different image sizes? Any estimate about how many sites may be affected by that? Any suggestions on how to deal with it? Do you know what happens when post-processing of an uploaded image fails?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Frankly for now it seems that this patch will have to be reverted and refactored in order to address this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Silverstein responded to his concerns with clarification on why they chose the current approach, in anticipation of certain edge cases and eventually adding support for formats like AVIF once it is more widely supported:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I tend to agree with your assessment that all sub-sizes should be generated as WebP only, that was the shape of the original proposal. For the vast majority of use cases/users this will work the best. I would be open to considering this for the default (with some mitigations, see below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason we decided to generate both formats was for backwards compatibility considerations for the few edge cases we identified where WebP images will might not work: namely emailed images (some older outlook/windows clients), Open Graph tags (some services don&#8217;t support WebP) and older Safari browsers. One possibility we considered would be to keep only the full sized JPEG so it is always available for those edge cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;multi-mime&#8221; support here is built to generating multiple formats so you sites can provide a primary and fallback format with something like the <code>picture</code> element. This is less important for WebP since it is so widely supported, but would be helpful for adopting newer formats like AVIF by plugins or core.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Silverstein also said the option of generating images on the fly was something they need to figure out but &#8220;felt out of scope for this effort.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the complaint regarding the dramatic increase in resources for image uploads, Silverstein said they are relying on the &#8220;retry&#8221; mechanism to mitigate this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This change also doubles the number of times WordPress will retry&#8217; the image regeneration, so while processing time will increase, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see a jump in failures necessarily,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know we had trouble adding new sizes in the past, however that was before we added the retry mechanism.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team behind the WebP by default project is more focused on serving smaller image sizes on the frontend and considers the additional resource usage on upload a necessary sacrifice for WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The additional resources at upload time needs to be weighed against the reduced resources of serving the smaller WebP image, especially since serving typically occurs several orders of magnitude more frequently than uploading,&#8221; Silverstein said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If uploading fails after all the retries, the user has the same experience as currently: they are left with a broken, unusable image. That can probably be fixed, although I don&#8217;t think this change will increases failure rates.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress lead developer Dion Hulse also <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:123\">commented</a> on the ticket to report issues with WebP conversions in the WordPress Photo Directory:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Just noting here, that these additional webp conversions appear to have been the leading cause of upload failures on the WordPress Photo Directory in recent weeks. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org//intertrac/ticket%3A6142\">#meta6142</a>&nbsp;and tickets closed as duplicate of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The errors were generally along the lines of&nbsp;<code>Allowed memory size of 256M bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 90M bytes</code>&nbsp;(obviously with byte values) while attempting to perform the initial full-size-original jpeg -&gt; webp conversion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hasn&#8217;t affected&nbsp;<em>every upload</em>, only that of certain images. Potentially related to the&nbsp;<code>$quality</code>&nbsp;value being passed for webp requests (IIRC the default of 82 was optimized for jpeg?).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Hulse <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12023\">disabled the JPEG to WebP conversion</a> as a result of these errors, as the photo directory doesn&#8217;t currently use WebP but noted that it &#8220;might be a sign that it might be worth considering only generating webp&#8217;s for the resized images, rather than for the original file too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silverstein said they are investigating the issues Hulse reported, as it may have exposed a bug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozz circled back to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:126\">recommend</a> that making sub-sizes on demand would be a better approach that has faster processing of uploaded images and reduced space requirements, since the additional JPEG images would not be generated unless needed. He also noted that the &#8220;retry&#8221; for image post-processing &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work as well as expected.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The bad news is that if the post processing fails, chances are the originally uploaded file will remain,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;Then it will be used everywhere as most of the code in WP falls back to available sizes, and the only size will be the original. That means we will be serving huge (4MB &#8211; 8MB average) images. A serious drawback.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silverstein responded to Ozz&#8217;s suggestions, agreeing with many, and proposed two potential paths forward for the project: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<ol><li>Keep the current multi-mime infrastructure, but change the defaults so only WebP files are generated, possibly up to a threshold size beyond which only JPEGs would be generated.

And you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes there as well. And so without further delay, I bring you Andrew Palmer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Andrew Palmer. How are you doing Andrew?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] Andrew Palmer: I&#8217;m very good. Nathan. Thanks very much for inviting me on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] Nathan Wrigley: We are in the bowels of the Super Bock Arena and let&#8217;s be honest, it was a challenge finding this room, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] Andrew Palmer: It was, and especially as I was running late and you&#8217;ve been very kind to still accommodate me, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:15] Nathan Wrigley: You are, most welcome. Andrew&#8217;s been in the WordPress community for years and years and years, but it&#8217;s not been always on the up and up has it? You&#8217;ve had your moments where you&#8217;ve stepped away for a little while and now you&#8217;ve reemerged. Is that true? Is that fair to say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] Andrew Palmer: Kind of, I mean, I sold Elegant Marketplace to the wonderful people that InMotion Hosting. So that enabled me to go off and play golf for a little while, and invest in other businesses and interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:39] Nathan Wrigley: Do you think this is for you, you know, a moment of excitement or are you still with tentative steps?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] Andrew Palmer: It could be construed as a resurgence. I mean, I&#8217;ve always connected with the WordPress community, cuz we&#8217;re such a friendly bunch. I had an opportunity to develop plugins and be a product maker, and I took over a lot of products from a very good friend of mine and hopefully we&#8217;ve enhanced them and made them better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;ve listed a, a few of the things that you&#8217;ve been involved in, but you&#8217;ve obviously been involved in lots of different businesses. Do you think with 50,000 plus plugins in the WordPress repository, countless commercial plugins, are we in a saturated marketplace? What I mean by that is if you are creating a new product, is it very difficult to be discovered? Is discoverability really difficult? Okay, let&#8217;s take two scenarios. The first one you&#8217;ve got a budget to advertise. And the second one is if you have to bootstrap it and do more or less all of it yourself. So two parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:36] Andrew Palmer: You know, if you&#8217;re gonna do jerk sauce it&#8217;s still hard. You know, you&#8217;ve got supermarkets, they do their own brand as well. As soon as a brand new hot sauce comes out, the supermarkets go, oh, we&#8217;ve got our own version of this, and they charge you a few hundred thousand pounds to be put on the supermarket shelves. So, there&#8217;s always a price to pay isn&#8217;t it, it&#8217;s a pay to play arena in every single business aspect. So the benefit that we have in WordPress is that we can throw something onto WordPress dot org, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, throw is maybe not the right word because it does go through a, a little bit of moderation, one would hope, but, um, you know, you can throw out a free version of what you&#8217;ve got and test the market. That&#8217;s really cool because, you throw out an MVP and people then like it and you then put some pro versions together or pro bits and pieces and say, okay, yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m willing to pay 10 30, 50, a hundred bucks for that a month or a year or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the competitive landscape of every business in the world is competitive by nature, because there are so many products out there that are similar. There&#8217;s loads of light bulbs out there. It&#8217;s not just Phillips. Loads of CDs, you know, it&#8217;s just not Phillips. So you gotta make your own way, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:51] Nathan Wrigley: With the whole plugin thing and the whole of saturation thing, you&#8217;ve launched several products over the course of your career. Most recently, maybe there&#8217;s something after this, but I think the most recent one is Bertha.ai. That&#8217;s actually the URL as well as the name of the product I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:07] Andrew Palmer: It is Bertha.ai. It&#8217;s uh, my very good friend and, uh, co-founder Vito Peleg phoned me far too early in the morning, because he gets up at five o&#8217;clock and said, hey, I got an idea, man, let&#8217;s do it. We did and financial situations, I&#8217;m the, you know, I&#8217;m the guy that&#8217;s got the cash and we invested in it and Vito invested, blood, sweat and tears as we all did. And I&#8217;ve got a development team, you know, and they worked really, really hard and we launched it at the end of September, 2021. It&#8217;s going well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] Nathan Wrigley: Is that the primary reason that you are here at WordCamp EU? Actually just rewind that a little bit. When the tickets were announced, I think you were the first person that I know who committed to coming. You probably weren&#8217;t the first person that bought a ticket, but in my social network, you were the first person who said, oh, I&#8217;ve done it. I&#8217;ve bought a plane ticket. I&#8217;ve got the hotel and blah, blah, blah. You must be fairly committed to these kind of events. And if that&#8217;s the case, what&#8217;s the thing? What&#8217;s the angle. Is it the community? Is it a bit of community, a bit of networking, a bit of marketing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:06] Andrew Palmer: It&#8217;s a lot about the community because, uh, I&#8217;m looking for developers, you know, so I need to chat to people and meet with people. And we are very lucky yesterday and got treated to a gin fest, by Codeable. Marcel who actually works in, for Codeable rather, in Portugal, did an event for Codeable and invited us all along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s all about networking, and we met a few, I met a few coders and had a good old chat, and that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s me networking. Supporting the community, as much as I possibly can, being a bootstrap business. It&#8217;s quite expensive developing a plugin and there&#8217;s lots of things you have to commit to like getting a new CMO, you know, in Stephanie Hudson. She&#8217;s got her own business to run and, and we&#8217;re all kind of bootstrap minded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we all have to do little things and Vito&#8217;s got Atarim to do so he&#8217;s gonna concentrate more on that now. So, you know, I needed a sidekick. Stephanie&#8217;s that sidekick, who&#8217;s got the strategy and the marketing nouse and she&#8217;s also based in the U.S. Which is good. And Bertha is now incorporated in the U.S. as well. So it&#8217;s all. Moving along swiftly, but I did actually release a GDPR plugin last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So GDPR friendly fonts, but it&#8217;s a commercial one. There&#8217;s a few free ones out there, but ours is good. So, launching things all the time and improving the plugins and making sure that we are in touch with what people in the community actually want, because we are here. Plugins, I think are more here to support the developer than the, than the end client. To give them an easier way to market if you like, or an easier or quicker, faster speedier way to get their product out, whether it&#8217;s, uh, an MVP for themselves or whether it&#8217;s a website for a direct client .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins and extensions and themes. And you know, what Gutenberg Hub doing with Gutenberg? What Extendify are doing with Gutenberg is quite amazing and all the form plugins out there, you know, we&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;ve got very good friend Mark Westguard who&#8217;s does WS Form. It happens to be my favorite form. We happen to get on, which is really cool. So it&#8217;s about meeting these people. Coming together in Europe, biggest WordCamp in the world. You know, pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:15] Nathan Wrigley: Do you have a battle plan though? Do you have, before you set off. I was wondering, because you said earlier you wanted to meet developers and today was contributor day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] Andrew Palmer: I couldn&#8217;t get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:23] Nathan Wrigley: Was it just because you were a bit late?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:25] Andrew Palmer: No, I was a contributor, I was just late. I just kind of thought, well, do you know what? And Stephanie runs the Focus WP Facebook group. So we had a little meet up and we&#8217;ve gone out on the town and just met with a few people from the Focus Facebook group as well. So there&#8217;s always networking opportunities. There&#8217;s nothing else to do a WordCamp than have a great look at Porto, which is probably one of the best venues you could choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food&#8217;s cheap, and good. The weather has turned out to be better than we thought it would be. There&#8217;s a little spits and spots of rain, but effectively Porto&#8217;s a great historical town as So, you know, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a bit of a vacation stroke job bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] Nathan Wrigley: You said that you were in search of developers and the bit was gonna develop there was, so there was 500 odd today and it felt busy. Tomorrow, maybe more like, touching 3000. So it&#8217;s gonna be really busy. And if you haven&#8217;t got a, I don&#8217;t know, an agenda and a meeting list, do you literally just try to work out who in the room is a developer by just going up and talking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:26] Andrew Palmer: Well, I&#8217;m gonna be standing on a booth as well for an hour or so. And I&#8217;m also going to, I&#8217;ve got a few meetings scheduled, which is pretty cool. With developers as well as, you know, funders and people like that who are interested in either investing in Bertha or doing some partnerships with Bertha and stuff like that. Because once you&#8217;ve got a plugin that kind of answers all the questions with copywriting within WordPress, people want to talk to you, which is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a long day, Nathan, you know, it&#8217;s a very long day and it goes into the evening. I&#8217;m gonna have opportunities to meet and chat with people all the time. I&#8217;ve got tons of Twitter messages to answer, and stuff like that. You know what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:02] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m struggling keep up with the different platforms. This person is over here on Slack, this person is over here on Twitter. Yeah it can be difficult. So let&#8217;s talk about your, well, I&#8217;m guessing the booth tomorrow is Bertha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:13] Andrew Palmer: No, the booth I&#8217;m gonna be helping out Atarim, because Vito&#8217;s a very good friend of mine and I know Atarim pretty well. I&#8217;ve used it from the very, very beginning, and now it&#8217;s on version three. It&#8217;s their third birthday. And Vito likes to run around. You can&#8217;t really keep him to a spot. There&#8217;s a bit of super glue we&#8217;ve snuck in there. But Alex Panagis, he&#8217;s gonna be on the booth as well, and I&#8217;ll be hanging around and just answering some questions that people don&#8217;t really get it or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, it&#8217;s so dual role. But of course Bertha&#8217;s gonna be mentioned in the conversations. Well, because that was actually the idea, is that Vito wanted an AI to be able to write within the note making facility, you know, you put these little notes on websites. So our first job was to make Bertha work in the front end of Atarim. And it does. So you can now, so customers can now say, right, I want this headline and then ask Bertha to generate an option for headlines and they&#8217;ll put it in. I want this paragraph here and all that kind of stuff, and Bertha can do that within Atarim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:10] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. I feel at this point, we should explain because we&#8217;ve stepped ahead. So okay, Bertha is a plugin for WordPress, which enables you to create AI content. So that could be any form of content. It&#8217;s just text, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:23] Andrew Palmer: Yeah, I think the best way to describe Bertha is that she is an AI copywriting assistant. So you are the editor, she&#8217;s the journalist that&#8217;s gone out and found the stories and the facts and the general content, and you working as the editor within WordPress, then edit that content and make it your own. And that&#8217;s the best way to describe Bertha. She&#8217;s not just a machine that says, right, write me a blog about this. We&#8217;ve got three things coming next week for the pro version. And one of them is very, very long form where you just give her a hint and she will write it for you. And then you just edit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:58] Nathan Wrigley: All right, let&#8217;s build up the jigsaw of how it all works. So we install the plugin, all of that normal stuff. How do we seed Bertha with the idea? So for example, let&#8217;s say that we want to write a blog post about WordCamp Europe. How do we seed the idea into Bertha, and how much do we need to seed in, in order to get something decent back? Let&#8217;s go with a title first, just the title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:19] Andrew Palmer: Okay. Title you just say, what do I want to write about? So you just write, what do I wanna write about, I wanna write about blog posts being written by AI. And then say generate a headline around that. And Bertha will give you four alternatives, or two alternatives or three, depending on how good your one was, and you click and that&#8217;s, that then goes into the text bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you say, right, okay, I&#8217;m writing a blog post about this. So I&#8217;m gonna go to the blog post topic ideas model, and I&#8217;m going to give it the title and then, or going to give Bertha the title and then you press generate text and Bertha will come up with one to four or one to five blog post topic ideas. And then you put number one in as the title in a paragraph generator, and that will generate your paragraphs around that first topic idea. And then you just go through. It&#8217;s of a workflow that you get into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:07] Nathan Wrigley: People listening to this, they&#8217;re gonna think, okay, this is voodoo. How does this work? How does it work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] Andrew Palmer: Well we&#8217;re very open about how it&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s it is open AI dot com, and we&#8217;ve written our own models. And we now use the latest version of GPT-3, which is really fast and uses things called suffixes and prefixes. And it writes much, much better quality AI generated content. And it has the previous GPT, DaVinci was up to, I think, uh, 1999 or whatever it was. It was ages ago. It scraped 10% of the web to get the ideas for the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is now 2021. June 2021. So much more recent content. If you wanna write about crypto, if you wanna write about FinTech or modern FinTech or anything that&#8217;s going on in the modern world. COVID for instance, you wanna write about that or the history of COVID from 1990, whenever it was. I can&#8217;t remember the dates COVID&#8217;s done my head in. It will write that history for you now. So it&#8217;s much better, much quicker, faster, better quality and, easier use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:16] Nathan Wrigley: People who&#8217;ve never used these tools before, they might have sort of concerns about a, does it scan, does it even read like a human wrote it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:24] Andrew Palmer: Oh, for sure it does, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:25] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So you can be pretty confident that it&#8217;s gonna scan well. But in terms of the quality, where do you stand on how much supervision. Is it like an aberrant child? Do you need to go back to it and give it some love and attention? Or is this a case of, I am just gonna press the button, not read, publish. There&#8217;s probably a bit of a spectrum, but how much of you come to trust it to be left to its own devices? Or how much do you go back through and read everything that it generated?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:52] Andrew Palmer: Well, when you are writing, you&#8217;re thinking about what you&#8217;re writing and Bertha does exactly the same thing. Doesn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s gonna write a paragraph ahead. Just like I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m gonna say 10 seconds ahead. But I&#8217;m forming the words in my head and then they come outta my mouth and whatever. And I will make a few missteps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know politicians make missteps all the time, cause they, maybe they don&#8217;t engage brain before whatever, but, you have to be the editor. What I don&#8217;t want Bertha to be is a total AI copywriting situation. Just write everything for you, because that&#8217;s not fair on you as a producer of content, it&#8217;s not fair on your readers and it will eventually work against you because your content will become repetitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will become not unique. You won&#8217;t have your tone of voice necessarily. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s up to you, which AI generator you want to use. If you&#8217;re gonna be a spammer, then use the others. If you&#8217;re gonna, gonna really invest in your copy, but with the help of an AI, Bertha&#8217;s the way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:57] Nathan Wrigley: So would it be fair to categorize if you&#8217;re gonna do longish form, it&#8217;s a launchpad. You click the button and there&#8217;s an idea here&#8217;s where you could go. Not necessarily, there&#8217;s the finished product. It&#8217;s a bit like a junior journalist would hand to an editor and say, I think that this is the finished product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:15] Andrew Palmer: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:15] Nathan Wrigley: Is that where we&#8217;re at? You should generate this content, then look at it yourself on every occasion because the AI, right where we are now is not quite to be trusted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:25] Andrew Palmer: Well, yeah, just exactly like Tesla. They do an auto drive. It&#8217;s definitely not to be trusted. I was in one a few weeks ago on my travels in the States and all of a sudden we turned left into a bunch of roadworks, well what&#8217;s that about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, the driver was supervising quite well, but you know, you can&#8217;t trust AI completely. And I don&#8217;t think you ever should. There should always be some human interaction. That&#8217;s what I believe in that. My aim is with website production is to make it quicker, better, faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:55] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. Yeah. And it helps with those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] Andrew Palmer: Yeah. I mean you&#8217;re gonna save between 80 and 90% of your time that you would normally write a thousand word blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:03] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I guess one of the concerns from people who maybe want to rail against this a little bit would be that that kind of control, that self control to go and read it, may not be forthcoming. In other words, we may have an internet where there&#8217;s tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, possibly of blogs out there that are just pumping out content, click the button, publish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:27] Andrew Palmer: Yeah but we&#8217;ve, let&#8217;s not be naive about this. We&#8217;ve always had that. There&#8217;s always been spinners of text and you know, the affiliate marketing world and the health and fitness world for years, you know, even before WordPress dare I say, you know, there was always people spinning content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why things like Copyscape exist. Try and make sure that nobody&#8217;s using your content. But Bertha&#8217;s not just for blog post writing. Bertha actually helps you with every single aspect of your website. And the whole reason that we&#8217;ve got it in WordPress is because you can go through each model or each template. And you can write your homepage. You can write your services page, you can write your about us page. You can enhance your product descriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s so many models now in templates in there now, and next week we&#8217;ll be launching social media templates as well. So you can write a Facebook ad or Twitter post or whatever, within Bertha. So, you know, there&#8217;s plenty to look at, and the fact it&#8217;s free is where I&#8217;m at. I think we&#8217;re helping the community get a grip with free AI. You get a thousand words a month for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:35] Nathan Wrigley: How does the UI actually work? So presumably we&#8217;re in Gutenberg or the old classic editor. How do we interact with it? So we click into the title, take us from there. Is it like Grammarly? Does something sort of hover over us, which says engage Bertha?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:48] Andrew Palmer: Pretty much. And it&#8217;s any page builder. It doesn&#8217;t need to be just classic editor or, it is literally any page builder. And the guys at visual builder, or Visual Composer rather. They helped us immensely with Visual Composer because they&#8217;ve rebuilt that from the ground up and helped us code Bertha so that she works perfectly with Visual Composer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a Divi guy. I needed it to work within Divi. That was quite challenging. We&#8217;ve managed to do that. And Elementor as well. So whatever you are in, whether you are in a text field in Gutenberg or a text field within any page builder that you choose to use, Bertha&#8217;s little icon is there, just winking at you saying, I&#8217;m here to help. You click on that and then a sidebar comes out and then you&#8217;ve got all the models and you&#8217;ve got the web or the blog, website, content, blog, AIDA, PAS, P A S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, we&#8217;ve even got evil Bertha, she&#8217;s quite fun. Bit of a sarcastic bot there. That was one of my favorites that we put in there. Uh, and then you have, on a separate dashboard, you have long form as well. So that&#8217;s a separate thing where you can just write long form content. Format it for your blog, and that will save, save it within your own database. And the benefit of Bertha is one, it&#8217;s unlimited users, because anybody that can sign into your website can use Bertha. Two it&#8217;s really accessible for WordPress users. If you&#8217;re used to WordPress, you can use Bertha and you can start using Bertha effectively within 10 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nice thing is, is that every single template has either a 30 second or one minute instructional video embedded in the sidebar. So you just play the video. You go, okay, that&#8217;s how I do that. The long form one, because it&#8217;s long form and it&#8217;s slightly more complex, you need to use a bit more logic with it, the instructional video is 10 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:30] Nathan Wrigley: The different language models that you&#8217;ve got, you mentioned the evil one and, you know, we could have the pirate one for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:36] Andrew Palmer: There is, we can do that tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:37] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. But there could be the sales for example, or I don&#8217;t know, whatever it may be. They genuinely spit out different content? And is that composed with a different choice of verbs or a different choice of vocabulary. And if you go for the humorous one it&#8217;s gonna throw out some curve balls and some interesting fruity language?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:54] Andrew Palmer: Frank Sinatra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:55] Nathan Wrigley: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:55] Andrew Palmer: Hey blue eyes, how you doing? We wanted it to be fun, right? So you&#8217;ve got the tone of voice. So you have your title. Who&#8217;s it aimed at? Is it business users, people that buy flowers, people that buy motorbikes, people that love WP Tavern? What&#8217;s the tone? Is it fun? Is it innovative? Is it classy? Is it hilarious? Is it Frank Sinatra? You know, you can put in those. Is it Rocky Balboa? You know, whatever you wanna put in there as the tone of voice. And, uh, Bertha will speak in that tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:25] Nathan Wrigley: Presumably GPT-3 means that there was a two and there will be a 4. Do you have any insight into that? Is that the kind of thing which rolls out on an annual basis?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:34] Andrew Palmer: GPT-3 has actually been improved. You&#8217;re on now DaVinci two. We use the highest engine, which is DaVinci ,and we use DaVinci two and there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s another thing called babble and other things within it. You can kind of downgrade it. So for evil Bertha we use, um, I think it&#8217;s babble because it kind of just, it&#8217;s more sarcastic. It kind of gives better results. So we test all the models within the playground of Open AI and then we go, okay, well that&#8217;s how we can write that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we write the, we write the prompts and that&#8217;s the benefit of us being web developers. You know, Vito&#8217;s done thousand websites, I&#8217;ve done hundreds and maybe a couple of thousand three, three or 4,000 actually, if I look back on it, cuz I&#8217;m old these days and I&#8217;ve been building websites pre WebPress, right. Macromedia jobs and, even Front Page, but there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know what people want in a website. The content, the kind of flow, the blurbs, even the content. We&#8217;ve actually got a model for the contact form blurb. How to ask people to contact you. Because we know websites. We&#8217;ve built it specifically for website owners and website developers and producers, because getting content out of a client, that&#8217;s why Atarim exists. Getting content out of a client is like getting blood out of a stone. if you give them a method to do it or a way to do it, you&#8217;ll get it much quicker. You&#8217;ll complete your projects quicker. You will then be able to take on more projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:59] Nathan Wrigley: So that&#8217;s an interesting piece, isn&#8217;t it? The idea that you can, well previously you&#8217;d fill it up with lorem. If the client didn&#8217;t deliver the text, in goes lorem just to fill the space. To give it some indication of how it might look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:10] Andrew Palmer: That&#8217;s why Bertha is called the Lorem Ipsum killer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:13] Nathan Wrigley: There you go, so that&#8217;s a really bonafide use of it, isn&#8217;t You basically push the button, fill it up with actual content. And even if the client doesn&#8217;t want to use it, then of course, I guess they could go in and edit it, or just start again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:25] Andrew Palmer: Exactly. Yeah. You can actually deliver a completed website to a client with text. In the right format, in the right places, everything. And it won&#8217;t add a great deal of time to your development process. It will save a massive amount of time on deliverables. The client will see it. They&#8217;ll get it. And they&#8217;ll go, well, actually, I don&#8217;t wanna use that word or I don&#8217;t, I think that&#8217;s outta context, let&#8217;s rewrite it to that, and you can even use Bertha to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] Nathan Wrigley: So can you, as a website builder who maybe only wants certain permissions to go out to your clients, you can enable them to use Bertha or not use Bertha? There&#8217;s different permissions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:00] Andrew Palmer: Yeah there is within the settings page. We&#8217;ve done a, a nice little dashboard, nice little onboarding as well, you know, makes it easier for people to understand what it is. And there&#8217;s an intro video on the onboarding as well, which will probably update because couple of things have slightly changed, but because we&#8217;ve embedded the instruction videos within Bertha, it makes it much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re launching a deep dive academy in a few weeks time, and it is a few weeks time, because we&#8217;re just building out the long form videos. So educational videos of how to write a blog post, how to build a website from scratch using Bertha. How to use particular page builders and stuff. And that&#8217;s being done by Imran Sadiq who has been a godsend on the training. I mean he produced 54 training videos in just under 21 days. So he was a find, I&#8217;ve gotta tell you. He&#8217;s my, he&#8217;s my favorite person currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:50] Nathan Wrigley: When you push the button, and it spits out content. Presumably there&#8217;s a cost to that. In other words, it goes to a computer somewhere else. Maybe that&#8217;s your computer. Maybe it&#8217;s somebody else&#8217;s infrastructure. I don&#8217;t know, but there&#8217;s a cost for that transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m guessing that there&#8217;s gonna be constraints on the free version. Maybe that&#8217;s the number of times you can click the button, the amount of text you can produce, because I know that there&#8217;s a premium version as well. Just talk us around the pricing and the constraints that you&#8217;ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:15] Andrew Palmer: Well, I made a decision because I, you know, I&#8217;ve invested in Bertha both time and money. I want people to use her. So a thousand words a month will cost me money, but that&#8217;s part of the investment, right? So currently, and I have no real reason to change this, everybody can use Bertha for free with every single model in it, except the new ones that I&#8217;ve said, because they are expensive to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So somebody&#8217;s gonna have to pay for those, and also pro users only get to use the academy as well. It&#8217;s free to pro users. So there are some constraints on the free use. But I, I love the fact that people are signing up. We&#8217;re getting probably 15 to 20 users signing up free per day, and they&#8217;re using it. Because we have a monitor. We, we don&#8217;t monitor what they use. We keep a record of what&#8217;s generated, but not by whom. You know, we don&#8217;t know which websites have generated, but that also helps us improve the model as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also if it gives empty responses, which sometimes it does. But we can see we&#8217;ve got a little, when a new user starts, we can see that there&#8217;s zero. And then within 10 minutes of them starting, they&#8217;ve used 250 words. We&#8217;re thinking, yay. You know, they&#8217;re getting it. They&#8217;re really looking at it. And then they go to 1,012 words because we&#8217;ve done it just over the thousand, because there&#8217;s nothing more frustrating when you click that button, you run out of words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, we let them, if it&#8217;s got to 998 and then they want to generate more, we let them generate the next sentence and they go, sorry, you gotta wait another month or upgrade. You know, of course I&#8217;m a very commercial person and people who know me know that I&#8217;m commercial, but you know, wait another month. But with a thousand words, you could write a homepage. You could write good about us page, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:57] Nathan Wrigley: The thought occurs to me that AI is getting its claw into almost everything. You&#8217;ve got Alexa in the living room and you&#8217;ve got the possibility to create pieces of artwork with all sorts of AI content. And I&#8217;m just wondering given your position, you&#8217;re obviously thinking a lot about AI. What do you make of the future of website building? So not the, not the content. Not that piece. The bit about the layout, the feel, the color palette, use of fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I just find it almost inevitable that at some point we&#8217;re gonna be talking to the website building process, and we&#8217;re gonna be saying, I want a homepage with a picture of a stadium in the background with these words, and then you&#8217;ll see what it puts out and actually no change the font. Make it H2 instead of an H1 and so on. Do you think that&#8217;s closer than I&#8217;m imagining? Cause I&#8217;m still thinking that&#8217;s decades off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:49] Andrew Palmer: Oh, it&#8217;s definitely not decades off. It&#8217;s 24 months off. You know, if you really, really get into it because, um, Google are working on image generation. But let&#8217;s also not forget that AI can examine an image and see what&#8217;s in it. So, the stock Adobes, the Shutterstocks of this world will think, well, hang on a second, we can tie up with an AI and ask it to recognize this gray head fella in a rowing boat, doing some fishing, whatever, no offense Nathan, and then produce that image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it would be, it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have to be an AI generated image because there are millions of, of images out there. And imagine if you&#8217;ve got the WordPress repository with that&#8217;s now, and I&#8217;ve forgotten the name of where the images are on WordPress, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:34] Nathan Wrigley: Openverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:36] Andrew Palmer: So Openverse is an AI feeder of images. You know, I want a nice lakeside image with no people in it, because that&#8217;s part of the Openverse terms and conditions. There&#8217;s no people in it, but I want a nice lakeside view, in landscape and I want the sun to be shining. And the AI will go out and search that, find that, and place it within your Gutenberg block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:55] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s interesting because I wonder, I wonder if people, so the particular next thing I&#8217;m gonna say relates to Bertha.ai. So I wonder if it&#8217;s got content creators, people whose job is to create copy. She&#8217;s got them shaking in their boots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, I wonder if this event that we&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe, 2022. I wonder if in two or three years time given everything that you&#8217;ve just said, maybe coming down the pipe, if it will be a totally different experience. The whole build process will be different and we&#8217;ll be concerning ourselves with all sorts of other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the block editor might be a very, very different thing. And page builders look different. With the rate of change, and the fact that AI can sort of seed itself and make itself cleverer, much, much more quickly than we can, I do wonder what it&#8217;s gonna be like in a few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:40] Andrew Palmer: There are some very clever people out there as well. You know, let&#8217;s not name drop too many people. Elementor for instance, who&#8217;ve got their cloud version now. In there, there&#8217;s a, a workflow and say, what type of websites you want? What do you want it to look like? What&#8217;s the colorways and boom, there it is. Extendify doing the same. You&#8217;ve got all the content blocks. What do you want in there? And you take you through a workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress will do that with their new $5 a month package, you know, and hosting and they&#8217;ll, they will build your website on the fly and, and, BoldGrid, I think it&#8217;s BoldGrid by, InMotion. It&#8217;s like a page builder that people don&#8217;t actually know about, but when I got into conversations with InMotion about them buying Elegant Marketplace, and I was basically a Divi marketplace, I&#8217;m saying, why don&#8217;t we make stuff BoldGrid, because you can go in there and say, I want a florist website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Press a button, you&#8217;ve got 10 pages of flourish websites with all the images and the text. All you do is go in and edit the text. So that&#8217;s not AI, that&#8217;s just intelligent people saying, this is how we want people to build websites. So, with the advantages of AI and people like Matthew Renze, who I met in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. He&#8217;s at the top level of AI, and some conversations that I have with him, what&#8217;s coming, man is gonna blow your head off. It&#8217;s crazy what&#8217;s coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:57] Nathan Wrigley: On that bombshell. Andrew Palmer. Thanks for joining us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:00] Andrew Palmer: You&#8217;re more than welcome Nathan.

Theme authors have frequently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-is-there-a-starter-for-building-block-themes\">asked if there is a good starter theme for building block themes</a>, but at the moment there are really only a handful, as the block themes era is just dawning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WebREDONE, a Serbia-based web agency, has open sourced its new starter theme, <a href=\"https://webredone.com/blog/wordpress-theme-starter-theme-redone/\">Theme Redone</a>, that offers a foundation for building websites and Gutenberg blocks with an MVC framework:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>We’ve taken the inspiration from Laravel and other similar projects that really approached this aspect of coding cleverly and made it a breeze to organize and reason about the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Laravel, we would write plain old PHP for the logic, and then we would use Blade templates for the View layer, we also have model, view, and controller files to separate the concerns and organize code logically and efficiently. We have adopted that same approach but in the context of the WordPress environment. Conceptually, the way we organize code is similar to Laravel, but with a few differences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme Redone brings this approach to Gutenberg block files, identifying a &nbsp;<a href=\"https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/model-json/\">model.json</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/controller-php/\">controller.php</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/view-latte/\">view.latte</a> file.

Select extensions can be loaded up on a private test site for 30 days before the site self-destructs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although WooCommerce.com already offers a 30 day money back guarantee if users are unhappy with a purchase, the sandbox testing offers a frontline prevention for customers having to invoke the money back guarantee. It saves both parties time and resources by allowing customers to test extensions against their unique inventory of needs without committing to buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flow for this feature is strategic in that it requires prospective customers to log in or create an account in order to test an extension. This enables users to come back and revisit their test sites later during the decision-making process. WooCommerce.com can also collect data on how many sandboxes are started for each of its extensions and determine which ones are struggling to convert. I would not be surprised if WooCommerce ends up streamlining these sandboxes for better conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In my test of this feature I chose the WooCommerce Pre-Orders extension. Once logged in, the site loaded up in seconds with the extension already activated on an empty store. I was successfully able to create a product as being available for pre-order.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The live testing feature is not yet available for all extensions. WooCommerce engineer Rémi Corson reports that it&#8217;s currently active on the following products (with more on come in the future): follow-up emails, product add-ons, product CSV import suite, product vendors, table rate shipping, bookings, checkout field editor, points and rewards, and  pre-orders. Any of the available extensions can be simultaneously activated on an existing test site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce.com&#8217;s sandbox sites are set up strictly for testing extensions in a simple way. This may not be the best if you need to rule out conflicts with other extensions during your tests. The test sites do not allow you to install a different theme or add any other plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, the live testing feature should be adequate to answer most questions users have prior to purchasing an extension. It&#8217;s also great for demonstrating to a client in case of the necessity to justify the expense. Some of these extensions are in the range of $100-$249/year billed annually, which is not a trivial expense for people who are just getting started with a store and wondering if the extension will suit their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce.com is one of many digital product creators in the WordPress space that already employs this type of testing, though the life of the sandbox varies from an hour to several weeks. Offering instant live testing is definitely the way to go if you don&#8217;t want to offer a free version of your extension where users would pay to upgrade. It saves users the hassle of having to set up their own test sites and get a refund, but also allows them to truly browse a host of commercial add-ons that they may not have otherwise thought to explore.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 01:37:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.1 to Add a Block Themes Filter to Menu on the Theme Install Screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137238\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-1-to-add-a-block-themes-filter-to-menu-on-the-theme-install-screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1575:\"<p>In July, WordPress&#8217; Themes and Meta teams collaborated to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-adds-block-themes-to-filter-menu\">add a new “Block Themes” menu item</a> to the filter menu on the directory homepage in an effort to improve block themes&#8217; visibility. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">Block themes</a> currently account for less than 2% of the directory&#8217;s 9,900 themes but activating one is the only way users can take advantage of WordPress&#8217; full-site editing capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all users hunt for their next theme directly on WordPress.org.

The Gutenberg plugin is in active development and new features are created all the time. These new features come also with new APIs that are declared &#8216;experimental&#8217; until the team is sure that it&#8217;s a prudent implementation for this part of block editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a major WordPress release is worked on, Gutenberg plugin code is merged with WordPress Core, and when these experimental APIs make it into the stable version of WordPress, they also earn consideration for backwards compatibility and de-facto code that needs to be maintained for a  few versions before they can be deprecated again.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Zielinski suggests that before a feature makes it into Core that experiemental APis are audited and either are not merged into WordPress or worked on to migrate them as stable APIs. If a feature depending on  an experiemental API is not yet stable enough, and other features also depend on the API, both should not be deemed mergable to the next major WordPress version. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other developers caution, that it might slow down the pace when new block editor features come to WordPress. For the impatient that might be of concern, I also have the feeling that it&#8217;s not a bad thing, when Gutenberg latests features stay in the oven to bake a little longer before they are merged and used by millions of people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding </strong>also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-proposal-calls-for-contributors-to-stop-merging-experimental-apis-from-gutenberg-to-wordpress-core\"><strong>New Proposal Calls for Contributors to Stop Merging Experimental APIs from Gutenberg to WordPress Core</strong></a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>🎙️ </strong> New episode: <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-71-fluid-typography-block-api/\">Gutenberg Changelog #71 – Gutenberg 13.8, Fluid Typography, updates to the  Block API and more</a> &#8211; with co-hosts Grzegorz Ziolkowski and Birgit Pauli-Haack </p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-g\">Gutenberg Plugin Releases</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> wrote about Gutenberg 13.8 on the WP Tavern. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-8-introduces-fluid-typography-support-and-revamped-quote-block\"><strong>Gutenberg 13.8 Introduces Fluid Typography Support and Revamped Quote Block</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Gutenberg 13.8, the first implementation of fluid typography is available. <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> posted a Call for <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/08/15/testing-and-feedback-for-the-fluid-typography-feature/\">Testing and Feedback for the Fluid Typography Feature</a> </strong>asking theme developer to stress test the feature with classic, hybrid and block themes and various other scenarios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime Gutenberg 13.9 was released. <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/oandregal\">André Maneiro</a></strong> was the release lead and published the posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-9-17-august/\"><strong>What’s new in Gutenberg 13.9?

Still, it\'s been an occasion to learn and think more deeply about the culture and history of WordPress, how things work or don\'t work.

Clarifying language and coming to some consensus about the terms and definitions that help people understand the project is really important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-718bb272-a14c-4904-ab72-ded6fd3e100e\">However, a lot of valid points about those terms and the details of the 5ftF program got deep into the weeds or focused on things that simply are what they are and aren\'t going to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(That\'s the stuff that gets labelled &#8220;drama&#8221; and falls on deaf ears or gets batted around unhelpfully by people who should have better things to do.  Everyone has heard it a million times. Don\'t worry, I\'m not going to touch any of it.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-5c310172-f0f5-4a15-89fb-9d9383586416\">We can only move forward, but are we living in the past?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-6c135ce9-57d9-48af-8a0d-e0bd756ba174\">As an open source project, the only question that really matters is, &#8220;What will drive WordPress forward?&#8221; Not in an ideal or theoretical world but with the army we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-563ef72a-ad24-4271-bdaa-2d540b279c33\">Or, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/08/01/open-source-and-the-free-rider-problem/\">as Josepha Haden-Chomphosy put it</a>: &#8220;How can we rebalance the tenacious need for contribution with the immense benefit WordPress brings to everyone&#8221; in the WordPress ecosystem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-cb7c0968-427e-4652-8704-a63477ffcd44\">That question got lost in the reactions, but it\'s the one that matters most.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Notice how these words are delicately balanced and easily tipped over. You can read &#8220;tenacious need for contribution&#8221; as a threatening demand — a clawback on a &#8220;benefit&#8221; you might not consider &#8220;immense&#8221; or as immense as someone else\'s.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-907aaa2f-8d3f-45af-9c7a-9bfe571224f6\">Notice how these words are delicately balanced and easily tipped over. You can read that &#8220;tenacious need for contribution&#8221; as a threatening demand — a clawback on a &#8220;benefit&#8221; you might not consider &#8220;immense&#8221; or as immense as someone else\'s. You can read it as a description of scarcity all on one side and abundance all on the other. You could tear it up and set it on fire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some people do do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The world as it is</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-42326f40-b8b4-4d74-af21-e69be310347a\">Especially in the world of WordPress extenders, builders, and generally small business operators doing well enough to start a podcast or opinion blog, this seems to be where we get stuck. (That\'s the big, long tail of the open source communities I\'ve been in for two decades.) I\'ve watched this all happen before around an open source CMS that once dominated the market. Imbalances, inequities, and unfairness got emphasized, and the community didn\'t get past its deadlock of grievances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-42326f40-b8b4-4d74-af21-e69be310347a\">I\'m not going to say there aren\'t imbalances and all the playing fields are perfectly level because that\'s not true. (It never is, anywhere.) But I will say it doesn\'t do any good to keep saying this. Repetition of failed patterns is not just a definition of derangement, it is a failure to grow into mature thinking. To really face the world as it is requires a capacity for living with apparently unsolvable contradictions. It is less about &#8220;being smart&#8221; and more about a tolerance for the mental stress and pain of not having control or all the answers. It\'s fucking hard, but not being able to do it does harm to individuals and the groups they\'re in. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We can cope better with hard problems and survive to solve them another day if we first get ourselves united around common interests, motivations, and values. And that is the task our oldest, most adapatable, legacy systems — human languages — were invented to do as we muddle along together on this planet.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-505bdd5e-f2fe-4c3c-9673-566df571dcf1\">I\'m also not going to say we can make deep problems disappear by not talking about them or by using evasive language. I do think we can cope better with hard problems and survive to solve them another day if we first get ourselves united around common interests, motivations, and values. And that is the task that human languages were invented for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-24ad1539-b961-418f-b0f9-9d1098a1392a\">There\'s nothing like an external threat to unite people, usually. Lately there\'s been a lot of concern about the end to growth and possible losses in WordPress\' market share. I\'d worry more about losing relevance with younger generations of people with different outlooks, interests, and needs. That\'s people doing stuff. It\'s real. Market share will always be a statistic that dimly reflects what people are doing long after they started doing it. Today\'s failure to connect and communicate won\'t register on <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/cms\">the BuiltWith pie chart</a> for years when it\'s too late to get in front of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creators in community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-7dad336b-aaf2-4a48-a2c5-be3f8cb710ce\">So let\'s talk about the &#8220;Creator Economy.&#8221; It\'s not a trend but a pretty established thing now. Creators with a course, service, or product to sell generally don\'t want to focus too much on tools and even less on code — unless code is their service or product.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>That\'s where WordPress should be, and in a sense it is, but it uses the language of a 20 year-old open source project that is illegible to people in their 20s today.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-7d4fd33c-af8a-440d-807f-2e3f36ae4772\">WordPress and ever-increasing, low-cost, easy-to-use SaaS platforms have enabled Creators to focus on their business. Unlike those of us who were doing this back in the Stone Age, Creators don\'t have to install WordPress, try to bolt on installs of phpBB, GNU Mailman, and learn PHP4 to cope with a once-popular horror like osCommerce. Creators are in, or adjacent to the WordPress community, but they\'re unlikely to participate in it and contribute in the old, traditional ways that start with bugs and hacking. Software that\'s free as in beer and speech isn\'t attractive or even meaningful unless it\'s presented as a useful platform for their particular niche. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-7d4fd33c-af8a-440d-807f-2e3f36ae4772\">This is painful to hear, especially if this is how you entered the open source and WordPress community. Many of us became developers, designers, freelancers, communication and marketing consultants, and even product or agency founders this way. That was a different time in a different country — once the main doorway into WordPress, it\'s now a small, creaky backdoor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-f154735a-096a-4c53-a676-455606234ca8\">If you think this means Creators are narcissists and mercenaries who don\'t participate in communities or care about their tools, you are wrong. Helping them organize into communities that give them value is a smart move. WordPress products, especially ecosystem plugins, virtually grow their own communities. With a now-private Facebook page that\'s grown to over 133,000 members, <a href=\"https://elementor.com/\">Elementor is the biggest example of this</a>, and they are pivoting to redefine themselves accordingly. Their identity doesn\'t emphasize a WordPress plugin but a platform (and community) for Creators. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-f02749a6-c26d-4c1c-a349-444397d597d0\">That\'s where WordPress should be, and in a sense it is, but it uses the language of a 20 year-old open source project that is illegible to most people in their teens and twenties today. And if they look a little way into the very limited &#8220;WordPress news&#8221; space, Creators aren\'t going to see Creators there. Certainly not a wide range of artists and makers. They may see &#8220;drama&#8221; and arguments, or &#8220;inside-baseball&#8221; like this post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-b4807b88-ab9a-4ce7-9086-3d43929ede71\">Craft + Commerce and WordCamp US</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-60bdea77-3b00-4542-8adb-25b820780a7d\">I found Joe Casabona\'s &#8220;<a href=\"https://wpreview.io/a-tale-of-two-keynotes/\">Tale of Two Keynotes</a>&#8221; really helpful for understanding some key threats and opportunities WordPress needs to face in the context of today\'s Creator Economy. Joe\'s main point is that Creators focus on earning and growth in their businesses in a context where this message is encouraged and prioritized — and WordPress needs more of that. I\'m not opposed to that view, but it\'s not the main thing I got out of Joe\'s post and want to elaborate here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-3af73ea5-8fda-4846-8a60-557c2b9dc5ee\">Joe looks at the language ConvertKit founder Nathan Barry used to invite community participation in his last keynote for Craft + Commerce, a major conference aimed at Creators in his hometown of Boise, Idaho. Then he looks at the language of participation in Matt Mullenweg\'s speech in <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-comments-no-4-state-of-the-word-2021-analysis/\">the last State of the Word</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-fff2770d-4439-4673-9878-843a5481044a\">Barry emphasized goals that could be summed up as, &#8220;You can and should make a good living doing what you love in the creator economy!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Here are the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-team-responses-to-the-state-of-the-word-2021/\">Post Status team responses to SotW 2021</a>. Rereading my own remarks, I\'m reminded of how optimistic that moment was — about all the same themes I\'m touching here.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-98dc48a3-e947-4e5f-8260-33984b488b5d\">Matt emphasized learning through contribution and the danger of more being taken out than given back. What stands out most in my memory is his &#8220;Give a penny, take a penny&#8221; analogy for open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-18f2b1bb-119f-47db-b4cf-0ec4cb188eec\">(That\'s not a knock on Matt, pennies, his analogy, or least of all the idea that you learn by doing — with others who know more. Post Status is all about that. We repeat &#8220;learn by helping&#8221; all the time. An example of this actually went out in our latest newsletter. But I do think &#8220;learn how to earn together&#8221; is a unique emphasis of the Post Status community within WordPress, and it is closer to Barry\'s language than anything as close to the project as Post Status is.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-2c2832da-0b83-467c-80a9-e5a11f17d025\">As he seemed to intend, Matt\'s keynote reminded me of the values of small towns at their best, where I\'ve lived about half my life. That part of me sees Barry as a bit of a huckster — sure, everyone\'s winner! What exactly is he giving you? Lifetime free access to ConvertKit? Or just high fives?</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-a1fad17e-5613-49e7-85d8-4783932d616c\">I don\'t see the two keynotes reflecting scarcity versus abundance thinking or even two very different attitudes, but if you wanted to polarize people over them you could. Pick on the vulnerabilities of one, and amplify the strengths of the other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are strengths and limitations to both emphases — Creating and Contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-a1fad17e-5613-49e7-85d8-4783932d616c\">What if we tried to combine the strengths of the language of contribution with new, complementary ideas and language from the Creator Economy?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-145fb39a-674f-43b8-8c1f-67c8f17881cb\">&#8220;Creators&#8221; vs. &#8220;Contributors&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-9a877702-0b72-40e0-a837-7a43f5155548\">There are strengths and limitations attached to both of these words when they\'re used to define identity and participation in a creative community. <em>Creating</em> and <em>Contributing</em>. They don\'t seem very different until you take a close look.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Creating manages to hold together both ideas of giving <em>and</em> gaining. Creativity is about making things you care about deeply and are inspired to work on. When you create something it\'s a gift to everyone, potentially, and to yourself.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-254f7428-0dd8-4a8e-adfb-d7d3f458a8eb\">Contributing has distinct emphasis on giving, not getting back. It is a zero-sum transaction between a contributor and recipient of contributions. To use the language of contribution effectively, you probably have to be seen as truly having a greater need than the people you are asking to contribute more. Better yet, they should see themselves as implicitly benefiting from their contributions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-254f7428-0dd8-4a8e-adfb-d7d3f458a8eb\">If they don\'t believe this is true, repeating the old magic words will not work unless you do it live on air, interrupting normal programming until enough contributions have come in. Until next time. (Kind of like Admin Notifications used for upselling premium plugins.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-991b730c-d674-41c3-abf1-e7068185e881\">Creating manages to hold together both ideas of giving <em>and</em> gaining. Creativity is about making things you care about deeply and are inspired to work on. When you create something it\'s a gift to everyone, potentially, and to yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So what should we do differently?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-9231192c-53a9-490f-b067-64e4d295c356\">Am I proposing a massive Search and Replace targeting all forms of the word &#8220;Contribute&#8221; in WordPress? Nope. I personally find calling people &#8220;Creators&#8221; more cringey than the older, grammatically tortured term, &#8220;Creatives.&#8221; But I recognize when I am out of date, and I am willing to adapt where I see value in doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-9231192c-53a9-490f-b067-64e4d295c356\">I\'m not proposing anything but that we think more carefully about language, tone, and audience. What we emphasize with one word or story as opposed to another may close or open doors with different people. It\'s good to have a lot of options to engage a lot of people. It\'s good to be flexible and adaptable. It\'s good to know what connects and unites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-e55a849a-8cf5-48f7-b311-570266746adf\">Do we know?<br /><br />Can we create it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-2d71356b-5b29-428e-a3e8-3618cb28851a\">Can we teach it to each other?</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status</a> • <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status - The Community for WordPress Professionals</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 03:28:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Join the WordPress World Photography Day Challenge\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137161\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/join-the-wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3044:\"<img />photo credit: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/author/chrisedwardsce/\">ChrisEdwardsCE</a>\n\n\n\n<p>In celebration of World Photography Day, WordPress&#8217; Photo Directory team has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/photos/2022/08/18/wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge-2022/\">issued a challenge</a> designed to get people contributing:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Submit a photo that captures something unique about your local area</strong>, in a way that helps represent the geographic diversity of the WordPress community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its launch, the WordPress Photo Directory has grown to 3,633 free, CC0-licensed photos. The purpose of this challenge is to raise awareness of the directory project and encourage people to contribute photos to expand the collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo contributors are encouraged to submit an original image of something from their local area (neighborhood, town, city, or country), such as a landscape, street, local wildlife, nature, or a landmark. In addition to following the directory guidelines, participants should also add the following information to denote their work as part of this initiative: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>(1) The location or where the image was taken (e.g. the city and/or country)</li><li>(2) The word WorldPhotographyDay22</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo Directory team contributor Marco Almeida has an additional recommendation for well-known locations that have an English counterpart for the name in the original language:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Quick suggestion for submissions: if you’re uploading a photo that has regional interest and the name of the place is not the same in English and the local language, do repeat the photo description in both languages. For example: “<em>Walking on Lisbon’s sidewalk &#8211; A andar na calçada de Lisboa</em>”. This will ensure the photo is both searchable by “Lisbon” and “Lisboa”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Submitted photos that are approved may be featured across WordPress.org&#8217;s social media channels. Photo contributors will also get a contributor badge on their WordPress.org profiles, which I was surprised to find on mine after contributing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/26962070d8/\">a picture of my morning oatmeal</a> a few months ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Participants can submit up to five photos at a time but will have to wait until those pass through review before submitting more. If your photo is approved, the Photo Directory team requests you leave a comment on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/photos/2022/08/18/wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge-2022/\">challenge post</a> with the link to the photo and the story behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More specific instructions for submitting photos are available in the announcement. If you are a photography enthusiast, this challenge is a great opportunity to give back to the world of free WordPress resources. The challenge will conclude on August 28, 2022.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 01:24:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: YITH Wonder: A New Free WordPress Theme with Support for WooCommerce and Full-Site Editing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137134\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/yith-wonder-a-new-free-wordpress-theme-with-support-for-woocommerce-and-full-site-editing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3194:\"<p><a href=\"https://yithemes.com/\">YITH</a>, a WooCommerce plugin development company that was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/newfold-digital-acquires-yith-to-expand-woocommerce-expertise\">acquired by Newfold Digital</a> in March 2022,  has released its first block theme on WordPress.org. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/yith-wonder/\">YITH Wonder</a> is now listed among 122 other <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">block themes</a> that support full-site editing and have recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-adds-block-themes-to-filter-menu\">gained their own menu link in the directory</a> to improve their visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>YITH Wonder includes 24 different patterns &#8211; many of them aimed at shops. Since the company specializes in WooCommerce products, it&#8217;s no surprise that YITH Wonder offers corresponding styles for WooCommerce products, shop pages, cart, and checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The theme also includes three full-page patterns for different homepage layouts and designs. These are very helpful for quickly putting together a page without having to hunt for and place each pattern in the right place. The full-page patterns can easily be previewed on the theme&#8217;s listing on WordPress.org: (<a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-1\">Homepage 1</a>, <a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-2\">Homepage 2</a>, and <a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-3\">Homepage 3)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>YITH Wonder comes with six different style variations that make it easy to change the the accent color combinations and typography for the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://wonder.yithemes.com/ecommerce/\">live demo</a> on the theme&#8217;s website. One handy feature on the demo is that you can click &#8220;Launch Sandbox&#8221; to instantly spin up a test site with the theme and WooCommerce pre-loaded. The sandbox sites expire after one hour. This gives a user the opportunity to explore the full-site editing features and see if the theme will work for their particular use case. For example, users can see how the WooCommerce product catalog template will look with their own customizations applied. The theme packages two dozen different templates and template parts that can be customized inside the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>YITH Wonder is listed as a multi-purpose WordPress theme in the directory but it really shines as one of the few free block-based themes built with WooCommerce in mind. Creating a new page and slapping one of the full-page patterns on it is a delightful experience that will save users time in getting started and also enable them to build targeted pages featuring different product categories or sale items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/yith-wonder/\">YITH Wonder</a> is available to download on WordPress.org for free. I couldn&#8217;t find any documentation for the theme, but it may be available once the company formally announces the theme on the YITH website.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 21:29:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 65) — How We Talk When We Talk About WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106145\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://poststatus.com/how-we-talk-when-we-talk-about-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53010:\"<div class=\"wp-container-25 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">What\'s it like to enter the WordPress community media space, especially as the editor of a publication with many voices, personalities, and perspectives? </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">42</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">My friend and dialogue partner, <strong>Nyasha Green</strong>, is six months into her role as Editorial Director at <strong>MasterWP</strong>, so today we\'re talking about what that\'s been like for Ny, what she\'s learned, and how we look at the WordPress media space we both work in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly we talk about conflict, communication, personality, and the importance of in-person events.

How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Good. Good. Pretty good for, uh, winding in towards the end of the week. I know. Um, let\'s see, your, your newsletter from master VP goes out Tuesday in our productions Friday. So maybe you can, it goes out Wednesday. Oh Wednesday now. Okay. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tuesday, Tuesdays. You\'re getting it already. Yeah. Okay. So you\'re kind of, is this the down slope for you? easier time,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> eh, yeah, it is. It is. The beginning of the week is always like, alright, make sure everything\'s together. And then it\'s like, ah, you know, breathe and like can hop in and getting ready for next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it definitely is. And it\'s almost Friday. Yeah. All good news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, for us it\'s like, yeah, it\'s the, the high, when you get it all done on, on Friday and then the weekend. So, um, you\'ve been at it for about six months. I read your your six month. Article, uh, post [00:01:00] there and reflection on all the stuff you, you guys have done in that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. How are you, how are you feeling about, um, about not just doing master WP, but this is kind of a new thing for you jumping straight into the, um, the WordPress community as someone who\'s, um, you know, come, come in from, uh, not that, not that long ago for the first. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. So, um, I\'ve had, I have a experience in WordPress, so I\'ve been coding in WordPress for a couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I\'ve been writing and editing for what 16 years. Um, and just, yeah, putting it all together to be like a part of the community to be a part of the writing, to be a part of, you know, everything that\'s going on. Um, it has been. Fun. I don\'t wanna say that first. It\'s been very fun. Um, it\'s also been very entertaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it\'s been [00:02:00] very interesting. Um, Hmm. It\'s been. Oh, oh, it\'s been just a journey. And, um, it\'s just been six months, but I\'ve learned a lot. I\'ve met a lot of really good people and I\'ve got to do, I\'ve gotten to do a lot of really cool things. Um, I\'m really excited for the rest of this, the next six months. I\'m just I\'m ready for that year article, like to just talk about everything we did in a year, um, But, um, I think the most interesting thing about it is, um, just, just getting to know so many people in the community, not just in the community, because like I was, I\'ve been in the community for years as a coder, but I haven\'t been like, you know, an active participant in like, as far as meeting people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So meeting active people in the community has been really awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, that\'s really different. Isn\'t it? I, I relate. It\'s a lot. I feel, um, I, I feel similarly because despite going back early long way with open source and, and WordPress [00:03:00] site, I probably got more involved long ago in other communities and I\'ve stayed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stayed for a long time in a, you know, relatively quiet, neutral space relative to, to post status and, and, um, and just, um, my own work for a long time. But it\'s, yeah, it\'s relatively recently that my role has kind of expanded and changed and re not, I wouldn\'t say required, but made it natural to, um, and if not, Necessary to, uh, you know, be more engaged in social media and, um, and just, yeah, the kind of networking that, that comes around from that and the, the way that people, uh, connect with you more when you\'re, you\'re taking more of a public role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. There\'s ups and downs, ups and downs to that. How, how do you, what, what do you see the pros and cons [00:04:00] or what have been the highs and lows for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, the pros would be the people I\'ve met, um, as a relative newcomer to the community and someone that\'s trying to get more people in, um, being, you know, editorial director of master WP has opened me to so many resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many people that want to help in this community. And I feel like that does not, nobody really talks about that. That doesn\'t, uh, that never makes it out of the screams. Drama whatever\'s going on that week in WordPress, but there are so many people that want to help the community, especially newbies, but they don\'t know how, or they they\'re more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will, I have resources for you to help, which is still helping. And I was able to connect with a lot of people. Um, I have been given a lot of resources for just starting my own word, press meetups in my city. I was just living in and the city I\'m doing now. People just they\'ve read and they\'ve seen things I\'ve [00:05:00] doing they\'re let me start over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'ve read things I\'ve written and they\'ve seen things I\'m doing and that spurred them to help. So it\'s been mostly positive. Um, for me. Great. Um, some of the cons is, um, something I, I\'m not new to leadership. I\'m not new to taking ownership of things. I\'ve had my own business before, things like that. Um, I guess the biggest thing for me is when master WP gets negative, press.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that\'s all people wanna talk about to me. Uh, if they talk about that, amongs the self that\'s, whatever that\'s it\'s okay. But when lots of really positive things happen, like I said, like me gaining these resources, us having, helping new people get into the community, people, uh, you know, changing their tune on things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They just didn\'t have information about which we\'ve, we\'ve been told all of us that that\'s helped at least someone, no, it is nothing. Nobody really wants to talk about it. And it could be because negative stuff, you know, people aren\'t louder when they\'re negative. Versus they\'re a little bit more [00:06:00] quiet when they\'re positive, but that\'s something that it didn\'t bother me at first, but it was overwhelming after a little while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm. Because. I\'m a person, like if it\'s something\'s negative, that\'s going on, I would like to work with you on it. But I quickly discovered a lot of people don\'t want that. They just wanna be negative and, you know, yeah. So navigating that\'s been interesting. Um, and then we, we, we shifted a lot. Master WP is completely different than what it was under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the old ownership. And I think a lot of people had a problem with that as well. Um, especially when we talked about race and diversity and oh, my favorite giving people money. I understand that. Cuz I talk about that in regular life. I\'ve been a community organizer for years. I do community service. Um, and I don\'t, I don\'t have to answer to an organization to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do stuff out of my own pocket. That\'s how I am. So this stuff is not new to me. Um, but it\'s, it\'s interesting to see people [00:07:00] take on those. You shouldn\'t be helping people or you shouldn\'t be doing. In a space where they constantly is, need a need for help. So I\'ve, I\'ve learned a lot. It\'s it\'s it helps me ponder and wonder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I, I don\'t know. I\'m just, I\'m very interested to see what else I learned because six months, depending on who you talk to is not a long time. I don\'t feel like that was a long time, but I poof I\'ve learned a lot. So this year should be pretty epic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah. You really jump right in and yeah, when you do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public like that. And you\'re, you\'re putting out the kind of material you do on, um, writing and, and podcasting mm-hmm um, yeah, you get, you get a lot, learn a lot from getting a lot of reactions fast and when you become the news it\'s, it\'s not, not awesome. I have a little experience with that. But yeah, no one can really control the message all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, [00:08:00] uh, being able to roll with that is, is good. But, um, yeah, I hope the, the positives outweigh the negatives. Where, where do you think the, um, some of the pushback or raised hackles? Come from, is it just, who are you to say, just where does this new, you know, just reaction of, of established or familiar, um, people who are familiar with the space and, and feel really, um, comfortable in it, the way it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I don\'t know who you are. You just come out of, you know, you\'re offering new perspectives and, you know, different, different takes on things or, um, is that. Is that just kind of the newcomer, um, challenge that I don\'t know, human social groups always seem to, to</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> have. Oh, I would be surprised if that wasn\'t playing a part into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, because, um, some people I have talked [00:09:00] with interviewed, you know, written to they\'ve written to me, you know, they\'ve been in this community like. Years and years while I might have been still been in high school, things like that. So I definitely, I, I could see some of that. Definitely. Um, I guess the big thing is nobody really addresses a lot of negative issues with me, which, which I\'m totally prepared for as editorial director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I it\'s, it\'s always secondhand stuff. And it\'s like, how do you address that? I\'m one of these people, like I said, I address things and that people take that in a negative way. I don\'t understand that. Like I. I have always been able to communicate with people. If there\'s a issue, I think we can solve it if we talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don\'t think a lot of people have that point of view. They don\'t want to talk, they don\'t wanna solve issues. They just want you to know they are not feeling it. And that\'s also fun. But, you know, as a person who\'s a doer, I can only accept so much of that, you know, send it to me, but what do you want me to do with it after a while it\'s gonna be my response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so it, [00:10:00] you know, there. I\'m a newbie, you know, we\'re new, I guess we\'re as a whole newish people on the scene. Um, although Rob and Brian and a lot of our, uh, developers have been in WordPress years. Mm-hmm um, there\'s also I don\'t know what I I\'ll call it. I always try to make up my own names for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s getting into the group. I guess liking what everyone else likes and hating what everyone else hates, which we, we won\'t do. And master WP is right. Individual people. We, we also, that\'s a big issue too. We get, if Rob has an issue on something, that means we all think it, if Brian has an issue on something that makes we all think it, if I have an issue with something that means we all think it and, um, that\'s not true at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. We are very open and diverse about that, but that, that gets lost too. So I think it\'s. , you know, we\'re not as a whole waiting and liking the right things. I can tell you as a person, an individual that will never be me. I\'ve never been able to do that. [00:11:00] Friends, family work. Yeah. I\'ve never been able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it won\'t be me, but, um, I think that plays a part into it too. And then I just think, you know, We\'re saying things that some people have told me privately, they wanna say, but they can\'t. So it\'s a number of things which I am so interested and totally down to explore in the next six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> That\'s good curiosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>helps, especially with, with negatives. Um, yeah. Why in, instead of just hardening up or closing off or writing people off, um, there\'s always something to learn. You know, it occurred to me listening. what you\'re, um, saying there about a publication with a lot of voices. Mm-hmm um, it occurs to me that there isn\'t we, and we talk about this a lot, the WordPress news space or whatever you want to call it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s pretty small. Mm-hmm and um, most of the people in it are, you know, we\'re pretty [00:12:00] small team at post status, but, um, there\'s, there\'s multiple voices and we, we aspire to. To have that, um, kind of sense of dialogue, but a lot of people are just doing, you know, it\'s one, one person, one personality. And so you, you get kind of used to their perspective on things mm-hmm , mm-hmm and maybe there\'s not as much of a familiarity with, um, in, in the space with, um, Hey, this is a publication where we actually want to have a lot of D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People and different diversity of views and they may not stack up or align and it\'s not planned. It\'s not to, to do so. It\'s not meant to, um, push a certain stance, but yeah, inevitably there are some kind of ranges of opinion that a, a publication will kind of get known, known for. Mm-hmm um, I wonder if that\'s just too new of a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don\'t [00:13:00] distinguish between, oh, who wrote this? Who wrote that? Um, yeah, I think that can, that can easily be part of it, but, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> you know, I didn\'t, you pray up a good point. I didn\'t, I, I did not. And we have talked about this, but I never really, I didn\'t, I didn\'t think about that. You just like enlighten me at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, uh, a lot of publications where it\'s not as many people. Getting a platform to talk about this many different things. So that could be very confusing to readers and people consuming our media. And that\'s. Thank you. That\'s something we need to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Thank you. Yeah. And, and a lot of, a lot of those individual voices have kind of been typecast, maybe unfairly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think sometimes even individuals change their views, moderate them, come to new opinions and things. But over time people tend, oh, this podcast, he thinks this way, she, she looks that way. [00:14:00] Um, That might be some of it. And, and also everyone\'s just guilty going so fast, having so much going by how, how deeply do we read or listen to things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. And we just kinda box people up quickly. Yes. Um, I, I, I, I think we\'re in personality. We\'re probably a bit alike in that, you know, liking a certain amount of. Friction and difference to have some have things to talk about, um, to learn from something that\'s not familiar or someone who doesn\'t agree with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yeah. Um, yeah. And you guys actually, you know, pay for advertise that you want, you disagree with this. You, we pay you just as much to write for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah. Come pay. We\'ll pay you $300 an article to come disagree with us and yeah. S I\'m hearing again, secondhand. So many people have these disagreements and I\'m like, why not get, get paid for it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s my dream to go disagree with people and get paid for it. Like if [00:15:00] someone had given me this opportunity when I was younger, I probably would be a lawyer because I would be so good at arguing with people. but, uh, yeah, we do because we do, we want to. Opposing views. Like we don\'t all, and we all don\'t agree with each other, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I love BTS. Brian does it. Um, Rob has his views on multisite. I\'m indifferent to it. , you know, we, but we all get labeled, like, you know, oh, if that\'s Rob\'s idea, then it\'s our idea. And I, I don\'t completely blame the community for that because that\'s life. Right. You know, when you think about, well, it\'s you think about like companies, sometimes companies get, um, mislabeled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I, I like to use the New York times as an example. Like the New York times is pretty progressive. Most of the time left leaning, in my opinion, that\'s subjective. And they will run op-eds with conservative point of views and Republicans and things like that. And they get crucified and it\'s like, everybody forgets that , they\'re running different opinions all the [00:16:00] time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, I, I think that\'s that\'s life sometimes too, so I don\'t take it personally. And, um, right. It\'s something we can always work on. I\'m always open to working on things. Yeah. And that\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> what you get from a democratized publication space that no, one\'s able to squash out one particular voice and, and ideally it, they can be in some kind of productive dialogue with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I, I think too listening to if, if you go, if your publication is, and, and a lot of, a lot of the. WordPress space is, is geared towards what\'s the drama of the day or what\'s, you know, what\'s the controversy up here. The, um, I wonder how much of it has to do with like energy levels, cause that stuff can raise energy and levels, expenditure and anxiety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and it also, there\'s a cognitive load to who is this? Who wrote this? Do I know them? Who are, you know, there\'s all this, it, it takes real effort to. To make that three dimensional to [00:17:00] make that connect, um, more deeply. And, and I think that\'s just what happens on the, on the internet, unless you make the effort or, you know, you meet it at word camp or something, something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\'t, you don\'t have context. And, um, I understand you don\'t want to deal with, um, a lot of noise some of the time. And, um, since I\'m not really running. Opinion or oriented, um, publication and actually going slow and focusing on more business pragmatics, a lot of the time and avoiding drama. That\'s, that\'s kind of what our longstanding, um, Attributes that people like that I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> thinks for the special sauce where\'s in that Dan where\'s oh, actually life is meant to be fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I [00:18:00] like to have fun. risk. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it\'s in, it\'s in there. I think it, I think it just comes SL it comes slower and. When you\'re able to do more listening and, and cover a lot of things, not just like what is going on in the core project, but, or automatic, but there\'s a whole ecosystem. There\'s little fish and big fish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s middle, middle sized ones. There\'s, there\'s all these different, um, concerns around the. The commons around, uh, WordPress that everyone has in common as they\'re what they\'re basing their business on in some way. So I don\'t know. I don\'t, I don\'t, I don\'t, I think that\'s fun too. It\'s a different kind though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and, and it doesn\'t, uh, it\'s, it\'s definitely, um, definitely a different maintains, a different mood. Um, but. [00:19:00] Yeah. What do do you, do you think that there\'s a, there\'s a, a regular current, we need to maintain in this space where there\'s critical questioning, um, a kind of dialogue going on that, um, that hits maybe some of the bigger, um, Bigger tougher questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Nope. I think people should be able to say whatever they want, you know, um, as long as it\'s not hate speech and no one yells bomb in a crowded theater, that\'s my opinion on that. Um, no, one\'s even when. Profess your love of things. People are going to disagree. I think no matter what you write, people are going to dis disagree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as you said, post status, you know, y\'all, y\'all have a pretty neutral stance on things and y\'all do a good job of it. And people still disagree with you. So, oh yeah. Um, no, I mean, you know, so it\'s like, there\'s no ways to avoid it. I don\'t think there\'s a plan for that, but, um, I don\'t, I don\'t, I don\'t [00:20:00] know the, I guess I\'m ponding that answer as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s something I\'m thinking about, but until then, I\'m not going to, you know, limit anyone. I want them to speak about everything. If we could talk about everything everywhere all at once, I would love that, but being realistic, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yeah. I wasn\'t suggesting it\'d be a limit limited in some way, but that, um, just the, the, this, the public, the WordPress public sphere, I say sometimes, you know, kind of the, the debate, um, arena, the public square it\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not always in the greatest shape, especially now you might, might, might exist. um, is there, is there work to be done there where there are unavoidable differences, disagreements, big thorny questions that do need to be maintain? Yeah. There [00:21:00] needs to be some dialogue maintained about those. And is that kind of more, what you\'re you\'re tackling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, honestly, no. Um, but because this is the thing and I, I\'m not just, just saying it for you. It\'s something I had to work with too. We\'re all. We\'re all from different places. We have different cultural backgrounds and we have different, even if we have the same cultural background, we have different upbringings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re different people. I don\'t think there\'s going to be a uniform way to do that with so many different personalities. I\'m not saying, you know, if it could be done. Sure. I just don\'t think it can be done. Um, we\'re also different. And I think honestly, if we embrace that more people wouldn\'t be, as you know, what\'s the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it wouldn\'t come off as, um, antagonistic. Is that a word? Did I make that up? Yeah. Yeah. I think people wouldn\'t be, be like that, but it\'s, it\'s like, okay, this person is this type of way. And we\'re just gonna write [00:22:00] them off as oh, that\'s them? No, let\'s, let\'s bring \'em in. Let\'s see why they\'re that way let\'s work together in this, this, this community, like a community should, um, if we\'re a community, a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They take, they take care of each other, they\'re they, you know, even their craziest member. Well, I gotta stop saying that. Um, even their members that we think are eccentric or we think are not like us, we take care of our, we take care of our own. And, um, I don\'t see that in the WordPress community. I see. Oh, that\'s just the way they are when that person could be one of the greatest people you\'ve ever made in your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you gave it a chance, um, or they could be horrible, but you know, what are we gonna do? We\'re gonna try. We\'re gonna not try. We\'re gonna give. Are we a community or not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, that, that\'s kind of what I mean, like, do you see yourself as kind of in your mission to, to try to create an inclusive space?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not one person or one, you know, organization or just one particular agenda and on any issue, [00:23:00] but, um, open kind of the open stage, um, ally, ally kind of brought that up. What was the mm-hmm the, um, podcast episode she did recently where. She talked, she called it debate club, which to me sounds a little little on the antagonistic side of, and she meant it more on, you know, like back in the olden days when maybe high, high school debate clubs were, were, uh, not, not as, uh, intense as I imagine they might be now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, just a space where, where you can, um, you. You can try out different ideas and it\'s, you know, it\'s not to be taken personally like this is, we\'re gonna try to, what\'s the best case you can make for this. What\'s the best way to look at this issue. And, and then how does someone who totally takes it another way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do they respond to it? Is that the kind of, would that be like a healthy, healthy thing [00:24:00] that you guys are shooting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> we don\'t have a uniform goal. So that\'s, that\'s again, a thing like is master WP. Doesn\'t have a, a, a one thing we\'re all trying to do. Um, so I mean, if you\'re asking me personally, um, I, again, I don\'t think that\'s possible because the people are so different and, um, I wanna just spin that on. Like, I\'m not saying like, everybody is like so different from me and I just feel overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I meet a. Uh, kindred spirits in the community. Um, but it\'s just like, even when you just said like, you know, debate club was kind of harsh, that was like probably the most, I think, polite thing you can say. I can\'t think of anything polite or to say and that\'s not anything wrong with you. That\'s just something I have to look at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, um, I try to, I\'m trying to make my language more accessible. Like not say things like crazy, like it tears me up to say that like, so, you know, that\'s something, um, I think, you know, I wanna work on, but also like I [00:25:00] don\'t, I don\'t know. That\'s something I\'ve never thought about. That\'s a that\'s Ally\'s idea and, you know, ally works with master WP, but we, we haven\'t talked about that as a whole, as master WP because master WP lets everybody express themselves and be their own person and have their own ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Not saying no one else does, but yeah. Um, I don\'t think it\'s possible me. Naisha saying that now the rest of my team may have different thoughts on that. And actually I think that\'s really awesome. And I want to talk to Allie about it. I wanna talk to my team about it. So, um, yeah, I\'ll definitely talk to them about it, but, um, I just don\'t see it as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also don\'t see it as necessary. Um, I don\'t, I don\'t, people are always going to yell and Twitter has given people the ability to yell from their homes. Like, you know, it\'s people who would yell at about stuff and complain and say things. They would never say if they had to say it in public, Twitter has given them that space and right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can\'t really take it away. Um, so I don\'t know Dan, to answer your question. I don\'t think it\'ll work, but I don\'t, I don\'t like saying nothing will work. I think everything should at least be [00:26:00] tried. Hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, I think, yeah, the more good models there are, um, the better, yeah, like checking, checking ourselves on the, what seems like crazy far out irrational, extreme opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, that\'s just, so that\'s such a common feature of when things get bad in a, in a community, um, inability to talk because. You\'re, you know, some other perspective is just so far, far out. And, uh, that, that may be the case. Maybe things are, you know, really that broken sometimes. But I would like to think, and I, I don\'t think they are in, um, something like in an open source community like WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you just kind of have to give people that, that tolerance. Forbearance is a good word. Um, and step back from, you know, recognizing this, okay. I don\'t know where they\'re coming [00:27:00] from. This doesn\'t make sense. I\'m gonna try to find out, I\'m gonna try to understand it from their point of view rather than oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, call it just nuts. Um, yeah, I think that\'s hard to do when we don\'t, we don\'t have a space where that, um, seems to happen. A lot. And it reminds me, it actually reminds me of way back when I did a lot with Jula kind of when they\'re at their high point and then over it, um, it\'s a lot, it was a lot similar to WordPress in that, um, They developed a, a third party plugin theme ecosystem is where there are a lot of people making good money and agencies and so on, and who really feel in invested in, in the product and then very, sometimes alienated from where it\'s going and how decisions get made and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and. That kind of language emerged, like just complete your perspective is so far out from mine clearly. , [00:28:00] it\'s, it\'s, um, not worth any time to try to understand. And yeah. Do you see that kind of thing going on? Is that something we can help in, in some way, is that just helped by letting more people. Have the</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> floor, more people need to be elevated in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Um, I get asked to do a lot of podcasts and things, you know, like what we\'re doing now. Sometimes I just say no, because I don\'t think I should be the only voice. I don\'t think I should be the only one talking for master WP. I don\'t think I should be the. No, nobody\'s like done this, but in, uh, outside of nobody\'s done this in the WordPress community, but outside of the WordPress community, I don\'t think I should be the black person you go to talk to about, about black issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think, um, Once I, I, you know, I, I have my voice and if I wanna say something and if I wanna talk to people, I can do it. Um, but other than that, I think we should be elevating people. I think if the community was a little bit more diverse, I know I say that all the [00:29:00] time, people would know how to deal with opposing opinions, from different people who may be from different backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see that I see it as diversity issue. I see some of the same people who click together, not agreeing with some of the other people who were the same and click together. And I\'m like, if you guys didn\'t do that, maybe you wouldn\'t be so upset all the time, but I don\'t know. What do I know? I\'m new. I\'m I\'m joking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, I guess would the, would there be a space where everybody could just be, not use bad language or threatening language and it\'d be like a little safer space for people. Again, culturally, I, I think that\'s impossible. Um, because you know, my, you could disagree with me as long as you don\'t cuss at me or yell at me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can disagree with me all day, but that\'s not with other people. It\'s like, you can\'t use certain word and completely understandable. You can\'t use certain words with me. You do that. That\'s that\'s, that\'s why I tap out. We have to learn that about each other. And if like, if [00:30:00] nobody\'s willing to learn that, and I mean, on both sides of people who don\'t want you to use any strong language, don\'t wanna learn that about other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, you know, strong language is not a big red flag to them. And I think people are misunderstanding each other. They\'re like, wow, he\'s, you know, they are just so threatening toward me. And they\'re like, I thought we were having a regular conversation or maybe on the other side of that, like, you know, I, I just it\'s people need to talk to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\'s communication problem. It\'s a diversity problem. It\'s communication problem. If we want those spaces to happen, people need to talk to each other. I don\'t see a lot of people talking to each other in the C. unless they agree with each other and that\'s bad in any community,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right? Yeah. The absence of, of any, any friction there, it\'s, it\'s a tough mm-hmm seeming paradox of the absence of, of conflict tends to indicate a problem because people are just individuals and, and different and you, and you need that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need questions and [00:31:00] friction to be. To come up with better ideas and to grow, to grow, to see things that you didn\'t wouldn\'t otherwise see. And, and if you\'re repressing all of that, it\'s gonna blow up some more dysfunctional way. Oh yeah. So yeah, the high conflict personality, I think in. Psychology is, is actually someone who, who just doesn\'t doesn\'t have any repertoire of responses to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a normal part of life and they try to avoid it and try to suppress it. And that actually causes more conflict than they just don\'t have the tools to, um, to deal with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Do you think, uh, maybe I, I have a question. I\'m sorry. You said high conflict people. Yeah. Right. Who, what would, uh, be your definition of high conflict people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I\'ll tell you mine, and then I can tell you, and then we can talk. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I think, I think the psychological model, um, that I dimly have read about is, um, it, you, it is [00:32:00] just the simple definition would be someone who ends up in conflict a lot. Um, and maybe they don\'t know why , um, mm-hmm they may not think they are because they\'re trying to avoid it all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm and. you know, like, um, say like the worst example would be like, you know, estrangement in a family or something like that. Mm-hmm so these two people don\'t talk mm-hmm at all. That\'s not a condition of detachment or peace. Uh it\'s a, it\'s a cold, it\'s a simmering thing that will go off as soon as they get together or something triggers it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So mm-hmm um, Yeah, high conflict tends to come from not being able to manage reasonable levels of conflict in reasonable ways, because that\'s just what human groups require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You don\'t think like most of what you said is kind of subjective though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh, sure. , it\'s just a, a model, uh, a hypothesis, I guess,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> but like, I, I think I could fit into [00:33:00] that because I, like I said, when I told tell people, like I address things, people can take that as like, if.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'ll like yell at you. If you say something to her, I can say, but it\'s not that I like to talk to people like positive, or it could be positive or negative. You could come to me and say, oh my God, ni I just had the great day ever. And I\'m gonna say what happened? Let\'s talk about it. You could come to me and say, I just had the worst day ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m like, dude, what happened? Let\'s talk about it. My responses will not change. Um, but just people who address things because we\'re in a community, we\'re in a society. , we\'re in a place where. People are very nonconfrontational. They are very nonconfrontational in the text space, not even just WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So I, I could come off as like confrontational or aggressive and I\'m not I\'m I will, my responses will be the same. I just, yeah. I like, I\'m curious. I told you, I\'m a naturally curious person. I ask you like 50 million questions a day and you always answer, and I appreciate you. and I, I, that, but that could be taken the wrong way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s [00:34:00] like, I\'m not a psychiatry person or psych psychological person. I can\'t look into all these things to see how we should treat these different people. And that, I just think we should have more opposing or diverse thoughts so we can, you know, get more people who are not just like in a echo chamber together, and then we can grow and make changes from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just, there\'s no way we\'re gonna get to a point where everybody\'s nice to each other because nice is subjective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Well, yeah, and there\'s a lot of culture in it too. I, I think what in the way I I\'m looking at it, um, the way you describe yourself and, um, I would probably fit in that, in that too, is, is not a high conflict personality, but people might who, because, because you\'re a pressure valve because you\'re, you\'re, you\'re not gonna bury stuff or, and it\'s not that big of a deal to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. But the per the person who\'s trying to avoid. Conflict that every turn is suppressing. What they really think is suppressing, [00:35:00] uh, things that probably matter a lot to them. And you don\'t even know. And then boom, it comes out at one point that\'s. Oh yeah. That\'s a really negative kind of conflict to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if, I don\'t know, you keep it kind of at a Luke warm level. A lot of the time, it\'s not, you know, that\'s pretty good. I\'m I\'m originally from the, the Northeast and. And there\'s , there\'s generally more time, especially in the Metro Northern New Jersey, New York, um, region there it\'s um, it\'s, uh, it\'s probably looked on as, as high conflict personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s aggressive. aggressive. Yeah. Drive. Sure. Learning to drive in, in New Jersey is fun. Um but it\'s actually, it gives you a lot of, it\'s a lot of tolerance. It\'s a lot of space because you can, people can push each other a long way and it\'s, and they have a lot of options to, um, , there\'s a lot of moves you can make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and a lot of it is. You know, [00:36:00] it\'s just, it\'s just talk it just Jerry Feld, people like to talk um, but then, you know, moving to the Midwest or the south at different times, totally different thing. And people don\'t interpret, um, you know, the threshold that they have for tolerating. Um, Um, open disagreement or questioning is lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh. So low differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> And , they love me here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah. I mean, I kind of missed the Southern ways of, of kind of. Backhanded dealing with</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> things. I don\'t miss this. We see we, we are opposing each other again. I, I love that New Jersey, New York, Boston way of, of being of talking to people because it\'s, you know me to understand it\'s it\'s so it\'s genuine, like here, like people could be talking to you and hate your gut, so you\'d never know oh, bless your heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So awesome. Like, [00:37:00] oh God, I hate that. Those are fighting words. So again, like someone might say, bless your heart. Oh, they\'re they\'re blessing you. I\'m like, no, they wanna fight. I\'m just kidding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I got used to it. I don\'t know it, but it\'s, it\'s a way of everyone knows is they\'re putting it off to the side. I, I never really figured out the, the Midwest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, doesn\'t really have anywhere for it to go and that, uh, that\'s a problem. I don\'t have a lot of west coast experience. I don\'t get it at all then. Oh, I love the west.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You don\'t like the west coast. We disagreeing again. Dan, we\'re supposed to be, I don\'t</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> know. I\'m just saying I\'m neutral. I mean, I hardly, I\'ve only been there a few times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m kind of probably biased against Southern California car, all that. I probably like the north in the bay area, but we\'re gonna, we\'ll actually meet each other. In San Diego so we can, yes, we can check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that\'s gonna be fun now that you say that I love the voice closed. The people are so laid back in my opinion.[00:38:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re so laid back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> that\'s the reputation. It just, yeah. Is there, is there something else going on underneath? I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That is so funny to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>huh? Insidious Californians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, yeah, it\'s a big, well, that\'s, it\'s a huge, we generalize like that. So these it\'s like GDP of a top, one of the largest countries, big population, very first, every respect and yeah, WordPress is, it\'s like California. It\'s like, like any big country. It\'s just, I think the diversity is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not, yeah, it\'s in, it\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> in. I\'m</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> sorry. There\'s there\'s not, there\'s a lot of underrepresentation of mm-hmm underrepresented groups. We that\'s definitely there, but there\'s huge diversity in the types of personalities and people and what their [00:39:00] experiences are and how they came into WordPress and how their business works and what ships they\'ve got on their shoulder or what words will trigger them off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don\'t know that, that stuff until you get up pretty, pretty close and. Yeah, I don\'t, I don\'t know if there\'s much we can do, um, podcasts or articles to, uh, smooth that process of, um, connection. I think that\'s more of an in person thing, your, your meetups that you\'re starting are probably most important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mentoring, you know, gets people together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. But I mean, if it\'s me mentoring and you. I have this stigma against me who people really be happy about that. not saying I do. I\'m just saying, um, just adding on what you said about diversity. Um, we need more diverse people too. I know we had diversity diverse minds, but if we were as diverse as Iowa am comfortable with every podcast I would get asked on, wouldn\'t be led by [00:40:00] white men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s been one, there\'s only been one I\'ve been. Or been asked to be beyond that wasn\'t led by white man, and it was led by alley my homie alley. So it\'s like, yeah, that\'s not diverse. That\'s that\'s not it at all. Um, diverse minds. Yeah. What do those mind, what are those minds attached to so I I\'ll, um, I think we need to go a little further with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think, I think we need to go a little further with that, but, um, I lost my thought. I\'m sorry. We need to go further. We need to go further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Definitely. And well, yeah, I think you\'ve affected change in that area. Winston, I think was early voice there and Allie and love her and you and love her. Um, yeah, I mean all people I, I hope to meet, um, and getting, um, kind of beginning to normalize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would you call it? Uh, travel [00:41:00] scholarships. Um, and yeah, you know, you wanna have underrepresented people here. Well, let\'s, let\'s meet the needs. Let\'s actually talk about that. I kind of like it\'s, it\'s too bad that, um, people are kind of desperate for getting tickets to word, word, camp us. Um, but I kind of like the fact that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are talking more openly about, um, about the process, you know, there\'s the whole what\'s, when are you going? What, what days? And all of this stuff, that\'s kind of all out, out in the open rather than just, um, I don\'t remember seeing that quite so much. It</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> used to be as like a secret, what was it? Tell me about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I don\'t know. No, no, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Maybe I just wasn\'t paying attention. It was not a secret, but, um, I think, I think that. That it\'s been a couple of things that it it\'s been so long since the last one, that this is kind of a [00:42:00] reboot plus everything else that\'s going on in the community. And then 600 5650 tickets, um, that went on the market and got snapped up in 45 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s, it\'s definitely, there\'s definitely more talk about. About the journey there and the importance and the importance of it. Um, and I don\'t know, that just seems good. Um, in some ways I, I wish, um, you know, I hope everyone can, well, I wish everyone could make it. Who wants to, I wasn\'t, I wasn\'t sure if I would, um, initially, but, um, Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people are saying, Hey, I need . Is there a way I can get, um, then, then that\'s in the, in the community there it\'s in like an a, it\'s a basic question of, um, can I get there? Can I be in, I wanna [00:43:00] be included in this, is that possible? Um, I just haven\'t seen that, that come up before. It\'s just a very private thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> well, I think that\'s. Well</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it\'s upside. I mean, it\'s not awesome that people, people are gonna get shot out. I or it\'s to something. No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, of course not. It\'s awesome. That. The want is that high, like, oh yeah. Especially to network and meet everybody in the community. Cuz I mean meeting face to face, I think, eh, it is COVID, I\'m kind of hesitant on that and what monkey pop now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugh. Oh yeah. But um, I think meeting will actually help people too. I think the internet gives you a lot. Gives not you. A lot of people louder, negative voices than they. Would usually have, yeah. I think a lot of, um, impersonal contact will, that\'ll be one thing that helps. So that that\'s an answer to your question earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s gonna help. We\'re gonna have such a good time at work camp and like, everybody\'s gonna be like happy and they\'re gonna love each other and your face. [00:44:00] I, I just wanna see your face, but I think you be like, Hmm, we\'re gonna, what,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> but it\'s gonna be good. You\'re reminding me of my. Friend and cop neighbor when I lived in, in Milwaukee and he, uh, what, nothing go ahead, get a certain personality type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and he was actually very sensitive and, uh, well, red guy, but, uh, if I mentioned. Anything that sounded like that. He\'d say something about like, uh, yeah. And all the animals and people will hold hands and dance around the trees together or something like that was</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> his. And why can\'t we do that? It\'s California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s Southern California. We can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, it\'s always, it\'s always worth the effort of getting, getting people together and it does happen. It\'s a very individual thing and I, I hope there is. More of that. I\'ve only gotten it online when, when I take the time to, [00:45:00] you know, take some blows and talk to people, um, listen, don\'t react and, and try to understand where they\'re coming from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s just, yeah, it\'s, it\'s so much easier in person usually because, um, yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> just empathy. Oh yeah. We need a lot more. You do you want me to end by like singing some Julie Andrews? I have a really great voice. Oh, wow. I\'m joking. I\'m joking, Dan. No, you look too excited. Never mind you look so excited by me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> there\'s a, there\'s a karaoke request from Miriam Schwab. Um, in our, in post dad, slack. Yeah. People are lining up. And then out burger trips</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> and I do love karaoke. Okay. We\'ll we\'ll do it in California. We\'re</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> you are, you are a singer. Is that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> true? I am not. I lied. No. Okay. I, I have like a people tell me I have a singing voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know what that [00:46:00] means. I guess I kind of, I, I like, sometimes my sentences are like long, like a song, like I\'ll extend out a word that I, I don\'t know, but I cannot sing. I will sing though, especially at karaoke. So you\'ll see. All</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right. I will definitely be watching. avoiding .

For this exercise he used WordPress&#8217; most recent default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. His results are not identical to WordPress&#8217; new designs but are very close, and he was able to whip up the homepage in approximately 20 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can I re-create the new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordpress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#wordpress</a> home page in 20 mins? <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png\" alt=\"😅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Here\'s my attempt on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/youtube?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#youtube</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/YeEDv914BF\">https://t.co/YeEDv914BF</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gutenberg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Vy7SB0HYYv\">pic.twitter.com/Vy7SB0HYYv</a></p>&mdash; Jamie Pootlepress &#8211; Gutenberg YouTuber and Builder (@pootlepress) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1559852989858332674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRrrYGpz9Qo\">video</a> (embedded below), Marsland walks through the creation of each section of the homepage. He is what one might describe as a power user with the block editor. He can quickly shuffle rows, columns, and groups around, adjusting padding and margins as necessary, and assign each section the corresponding color for the design. At this point, this is not something most average WordPress users could do, which is why the video had such a strong response from viewers. Marsland&#8217;s YouTube channel is centered around helping users <a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/wordpress-gutenberg-block-editor-guide/\">master building pages using Gutenberg</a> and stores with WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My conclusion was that it&#8217;s pretty easy to quickly get 95% of the design done, but it&#8217;s the final 5% that always takes the most time in my experience,&#8221; Marsland said. &#8220;My guess is that it was more about internal process that caused the delays, but without being involved its hard to say for sure. I really wanted to show that it wasn&#8217;t a Gutenberg issue with building the design (as Matt Mullenweg mentioned Wix and Squarespace and other WP pagebuilders.)&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Shiels, an Automattic-sponsored contributor on the project, cited a few items unrelated to the block editor, that caused the delays, including working towards &#8220;reasonable standards for a11y, responsiveness, browser compatibility, SEO, and performance,&#8221; as well as collaborating with contributors across different continents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to Marsland&#8217;s attempt, WordPress developer Patrick Boehner commented on how the little details remain extremely important. &#8220;You can definitely tell what was design driven first vs designed in the editor,&#8221; Boehner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1559550927731937280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1559550927731937280%7Ctwgr%5Ec3a5e9c1f1cbbf40cff90acba6f4cdf2acfe138a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D137103action%3Dedit\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after Gutenberg&#8217;s debut in WordPress, theme developers are still challenged to bring designs to life that were not created with a block-first approach in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It remains today fundamentally difficult to impossible to take a traditionally mocked up page design and execute that design using blocks,&#8221; WordPress developer Jon Brown <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-launches-new-homepage-and-download-page-designs#comment-431942\">said</a>. &#8220;This is a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sure, blocks are fine to &#8216;design a page in the browser&#8217; and accept what you get out of blocks, but blocks continue to lack the flexibility and controls needed to produce a responsive, accessible, pixel perfect layout based on a mock-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What used to take a day and a dozen lines of php and a dozen lines of css, now takes weeks of building custom blocks because the core blocks can’t easily be tweaked via hooks and lack the basic controls necessary.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg contributors are making strides by <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-8-introduces-fluid-typography-support-and-revamped-quote-block\">introducing fluid typography</a> and are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43241\">tracking a host of issues</a> related to improving design tooling consistency. In the meantime, theme developers are enduring the necessary growing pains as the block editor matures to accommodate those hoping to make their designs instantly responsive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’ve been building a full FSE theme from scratch and was surprised at how much of my design I was able to successfully replicate with the editor, theme.json and minimal-to-no custom CSS,&#8221; veteran theme developer Mike McAlister said. &#8220;Sure, it took a lot of tinkering, but I was impressed nonetheless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, as Jon mentions, the second you need to adjust something for a smaller screen (or bigger screen if you dare to try mobile-first design in the editor), you hit a wall. It’s particularly apparent with margin, padding, and block gap, which have no responsive controls yet. You can see this adjusted via CSS in the new theme on .org.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responsiveness is one of the issues Shiels cited in why implementing the designs took more time than simply recreating the design in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, there are hints of improvements coming for responsiveness,&#8221; McAlister commented. &#8220;Fluid typography and clamp() certainly have helped get typography in check, but there will always be circumstances where you need even finer control. Every other site builder has solved this, there’s no reason to think WordPress can’t or won’t. (I certainly hope so, as ~50-60% of traffic is coming from mobile devices these days!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the best ways to push past these growing pains is to have as much dog-fooding as possible — using the editor and FSE to build for as many real-life scenarios as possible to uncover these blindspots.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marsland&#8217;s short exercise shows just how close you can get to recreating WordPress.org&#8217;s design in a short amount of time if you know your way around the block editor. He was successful in proving that the Gutenberg page building UI isn&#8217;t the holdup in reproducing designs created in other applications. Rather, it&#8217;s all the other related checklist items that developers generally have to resolve outside of the editor &#8211; including accessibility, responsiveness, and SEO considerations. The closer Gutenberg can get to reducing extra work related to responsiveness and accessibility, the more approachable it will be for regular users trying to produce the designs they dream up on their own.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 21:34:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"Post Status: Post Status Picks for the Week of August 15\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106098\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-picks-for-the-week-of-august-15/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3061:\"<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-7-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Post Status Podcast Picks <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"🎙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Shop Talk Show: Andrew Walpole and Alex Riviere from Traina talk about their WordPress experience but also how they want to go further with more tools.

Here’s a great walkthrough on how to do that from interaction designer and front-end developer <strong>Dana Byerly</strong>. They show us how to use WordPress with the static site generator&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eleventy</a>. I have to say, this was one of the easiest and most straightforward tutorials I’ve seen in a long time. Very well done! Also their site design is simply gorgeous and wonderfully accessible. Hat tip to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/palmiak_fp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Maciek Palmowski</a>&nbsp;for the find!<br /><br /><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/08/15/testing-and-feedback-for-the-fluid-typography-feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Testing and Feedback for the Fluid Typography Feature</a><br />The Make WordPress team is looking for feedback on this new feature in Gutenberg. In case you’re not familiar, fluid typography will scale to the screen’s available room so it always looks good. It’s important that theme developers take a look and see how it might work. For instance, in the comments, Post Status member <strong>Mark Root-Wiley</strong> mentions that using&nbsp;<code>clamp</code>&nbsp;might have some accessibility issues that need to be looked into further.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-38 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-7-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 id=\"h-cool-tool\">Cool Tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week we’ll feature one cool tool that can help make your life easier as a WordPress builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-theme-palette-1-color has-text-color\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.programmingfonts.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><span>Programming Fonts</span></a></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This website helps you test drive monospaced fonts for programming.

The idea is to keep a happy, honest relationship between product development and its users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon\'s been around the WordPress product entrance-exit block before with <strong>SearchWP</strong>. His thinking about OrganizeWP <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/jon-christopher-has-a-series-running/\">goes back a few years</a> too. (Actually it goes back a decade, with OrganizeWP\'s predecessor, <a href=\"https://github.com/jchristopher/hierarchy/\">Hierarchy</a>.) He\'s documented a lot of the planning and iteration on his site, so there\'s a lot to learn from if you\'re interested in <a href=\"https://jonchristopher.us/blog/rethinking-wordpress-product-pricing-models/\">a different business model</a> for WordPress products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will it work? A lot of people with &#8220;subscription fatigue&#8221; seem to like the idea, what about the challenge of maintaining multiple major versions? That concern drives <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/organizewp-launches-with-old-school-software-pricing-model#comment-431950\">a skeptical take</a> from <strong>Carl Hancock</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-wordpress-admin-experience-still-a-blue-ocean\">The WordPress Admin Experience: Still a Blue Ocean</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at Jon\'s model, I wonder if OrganizeWP might be seen as a leading indicator for a couple of important trends and opportunities in the plugin business. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>OrganizeWP is a cool and needed product in an area that hasn\'t received a lot of love from plugin developers, let alone WordPress core: the wp-admin interface. WordPress core will catch up to the rest of the WordPress user experience on the other side of Gutenberg, but that\'s a few years away. So it surprises me how few plugin shops and developers have looked for opportunities in backend customization. (Only <strong><a href=\"https://publishpress.com\">PublishPress</a></strong> comes to mind as being really committed in this key area with their plugin suite.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress admin experience is something everyone wants to change when they\'re building sites for a team or larger group of users with unique content types and workflows. There\'s a large gap in what is available to that potentially high-end niche in the premium plugin marketplace. That\'s whose needs Jon is aiming to meet — freelancers, site builders, agencies. It\'s a good bet there\'s opportunity in those spaces, if you can go directly to the people there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Selling Outside WordPress.org: Don\'t Go Alone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Going directly to your target market touches the last and biggest item of note with OrganizeWP: it\'s not in the WordPress.org plugin repo. There was probably never any thought of putting it there. No freemium model. And at the same time, <strong>Lesley Sim</strong> has gotten attention for pulling <strong>Newsletter Glue</strong> <em>out</em> of the .org repo. Althought it\'s not exactly uncommon, the reasons why that choice gets made are worth deeper consideration for what it may say about the business and .org ecosystem today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropping Newsletter Glue\'s free version was a decision made some time ago, but the reasons behind it are really instructive for anyone starting out on the same path. Speaking to <strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> at the Tavern, Lesley <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/newsletter-glue-closes-free-plugin-on-wordpress-org\">noted</a> the challenges of the freemium model with a basic version in the plugin repo, especially if you don\'t have prior experience developing a product and marketing strategy for this approach. There\'s no onboarding for plugins owners where sharing current best practices (or simple checklists) with first time plugin owners helps them enter the WordPress.org marketplace. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opportunities for Partnerships</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Lesley, the main upside of using WordPress.org for distribution is access to the &#8220;[b]iggest distribution channel in WP.&#8221; It\'s an &#8220;easy way for reviewers to check out the plugin for free&#8221; without contacting the plugin owner too. And finally the .org repo serves as a &#8220;[s]ource of credibility” from customer reviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without alternative centralized marketplaces, going outside .org requires plugin owners to create and maximize their own distribution channels, generate their own sources of social proof and provide an interface for customer support. Then there\'s the barrier of customer confusion and frustration with having to assemble all the parts of their site themselves. Meanwhile, SaaS and no code alternatives are more visible than ever. WordPress hosting platforms targeting eCommerce niches are making the &#8220;looking for an easy button&#8221; market increasingly competitive. There are mature, established models for building a market outside the .org plugin repo, but that may also be a disadvantage to newcomers entering the space.                                              </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get past all these hurdles, why not work together more intentionally? Partnerships, networks, and community building could be the key to success. If other plugin shops and owners see the value in working together and trying to help their customers reach their goals simply and quickly, they can amplify their marketing and distribution networks together rather than try to do it all alone. (See &#8220;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/on-the-web-publishing-tool-race/\">On the Web Publishing Tool Race</a>.&#8221;) I\'d love to hear from anyone doing this or trying to do it, as a smaller, independent product owner today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Challenge: Lack of Market Data </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a premium plugin leaves or never enters a centralized distribution channel, it goes off the radar. We have less data about it and the overall shape of this part of the plugin ecosystem. Assuming the number of plugins sold outside centralized marketplaces has only grown over time with WordPress, we know less about the ecosystem as time goes on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The .org repo which can be measured. So can the new and growing WordPress.com marketplace. Large ecosystem plugins like Elementor with their own marketplaces are highly visible. But outside of centralized distribution channels, we don\'t know what\'s happening or even have a map of that market with any depth or breadth. That\'s another disadvantage to product owners in that space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are the centralized and decentralized products and markets all growing? At what rate relative to each other? However limited it may be, a key metric like active installs becomes an even bigger unknown when product owners set up shop outside the .org repository. That\'s data they could benefit from most directly. If that\'s something you\'re working on or thinking about deeply, I\'d love to chat. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-35 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Speaking of Market Data&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In the WooCommerce ecosystem compared with WordPress, <strong>Ellipsis</strong> has some new data and analysis published that attempts to answer the question, &#8220;<a href=\"https://getellipsis.com/blog/whos-winning-on-the-woocommerce-marketplace/\">Who is winning in the WooCommerce marketplace</a>?&#8221; Their conclusions:<ul><li>WooCommerce has been a lot stronger than ​WordPress this year.</li><li>70% commission on sales makes the WooCommerce Marketplace a viable sales channel.</li><li>$85,498,900 in estimated revenue from the WooCommerce Marketplace.</li><li>They\'ve also got the top 5 highest grossing products in the Woo marketplace, all estimated as grossing over $2 million (USD).</li></ul></li></ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status</a> • <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status - The Community for WordPress Professionals</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 15:30:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"WPTavern: Upcoming Free Workshops: Learn How to Convert Figma Files to a Block Theme and Take Block Patterns to the Next Level\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:136:\"https://wptavern.com/upcoming-free-workshops-learn-how-to-convert-figma-files-to-a-block-theme-and-take-block-patterns-to-the-next-level\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2931:\"<p>If you&#8217;re not following <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/learn-wordpress-online-workshops/\">Learn WordPress Online Workshops</a> on Meetup.com, you may be missing out on some high quality events.

The plugin was created to minimize customers abandoning their carts due to checkout complexity. It breaks the checkout experience into steps to make the process feel faster and simpler with a distraction-free design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flux Checkout 2.0.0 adds a new &#8220;Modern&#8221; theme  in addition to the plugin&#8217;s previous &#8220;Classic&#8221; theme that offers a more app-like checkout experience. Modern has a more minimalist black and grey design. Check out the <a href=\"https://demos.iconicwp.com/flux-checkout-for-woocommerce/checkout/#details\">live demo</a> to interact with the checkout preloaded with a few products.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The default Woo checkout is not optimized at all,&#8221; Iconic founder Jame Kemp said. &#8220;It presents you with the required fields, in a pretty unfriendly and overpowering way. If there are too many fields, the user is less likely to checkout.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing the default Woo checkout experience to Flux is a bit jarring, and it&#8217;s easy to see how customers may feel overwhelmed with the default. Fortunately, WooCommerce is extensible. The space could use more varied checkout plugins so store owners have more options to customize the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Default WooCommerce Checkout\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Flux reduces this friction by splitting the fields into steps and reducing the number of fields required to fill in,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;It also integrates an address auto complete to make filling in your address into a single field. We also cache the fields so if you accidentally refresh or navigate away, you don’t lose your info.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iconic<a href=\"https://iconicwp.com/blog/iconic-acquires-flux-checkout-woocommerce-checkout-plugin/\"> acquired Flux Checkout</a> in 2020, just as the pandemic was kicking off. Its chief competitor is <a href=\"https://www.checkoutwc.com/\">CheckoutWC</a>, which offers a similarly modern design, auto-populated fields, and additional templates at a higher price point. More than 3,900 WooCommerce sites are using CheckoutWC, but Kemp says Flux Checkout &#8220;wins on ease of use and simplified checkout.&#8221; In a few months, the company plans to release FluxPay, which will make it possible to &#8220;buy now&#8221; from product pages and will add other time-saving features for checking out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kemp reports Iconic&#8217;s WooCommerce products are active on more than 21,000 sites. The company is part of StellarWP and the Iconic team includes four developers, 2-3 support agents, a content writer, and a designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our most popular product is WooThumbs, but Flux, Delivery Slots, <a href=\"https://orderable.com/\">Orderable</a>, Attribute Swatches, and our All Access bundle are the most popular/profitable,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kemp first launched WooThumbs on CodeCanyon in 2011. The Iconic brand was formed in 2018 as a means to consolidate all of his  WooCommerce offerings and move off of CodeCanyon to become an independent brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re fortunate enough to have been in the WooCommerce space for many years and have a well-established customer base and set of products,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;Right now, and particularly throughout the pandemic, the Woo space has been booming. We&#8217;ve consistently seen growth as a WooCommerce product company. It is becoming a very competitive space and it&#8217;s important to stay on top of the features you&#8217;re offering.

And so without further delay, I bring you. Marieke Van De Rakt &amp; Taco Verdonschot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Marieke van de Rakt and Taco, go on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] Taco Verdonschot: Verdonschot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:49] Nathan Wrigley: I tried that many, many times in the past. How are you both doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:53] Taco Verdonschot: All good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:53] Marieke van de Rakt: Yeah. Great, great, great being back at an in-person event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:57] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. What are your thoughts about that. Genuinely, what are your thoughts about being back in in-person events? Because I know the Pavlovian response is, it&#8217;s great to be back. I think that, but is there any bit of you, which is mmm?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] Marieke van de Rakt: I have a hard time recognizing people because it&#8217;s been two years. I see now that everybody has that problem, so it&#8217;s like, I know you I&#8217;ve danced with you. I don&#8217;t know who you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:20] Taco Verdonschot: And especially when people are masked. You just see the eyes and, and if they like gained a lot of weight or became a bit grayer like me. Or lost a lot of weight, there&#8217;s definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] Marieke van de Rakt: It&#8217;s harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] Taco Verdonschot: It&#8217;s a change and with a mask on it&#8217;s a lot harder to recognize people. So I&#8217;m really happy with the badges that have the names on both sides. Which means that it will at least always give a clue and not be turned the wrong way like sometimes happens at WordCamps. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:50] Marieke van de Rakt: So I think it&#8217;s good being back, but it&#8217;s also, it&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s been a while seeing people in such a way. We&#8217;ve talked online, but that&#8217;s really different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:01] Nathan Wrigley: For me what&#8217;s strange, and I know this is gonna sound ridiculous, is that you are not this big and I&#8217;m making a gesture about six inches high, but also you both have entire bodies. It&#8217;s not just from the sort of waist up. We are on contributor today, so basically very little has happened so far. But what are your expectations of this event? What does Yoast bring when it comes to an event like this? What are you hoping to do? Do you have like a battle plan? Do you just bring the whole team and just see how it goes? I know you&#8217;ve got sponsorships and lots of things like that. So tell us what your agenda is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:32] Taco Verdonschot: We&#8217;re sponsoring, as you said, and we brought a nice booth. There will be activities, and of course there will be stroopwafels, loads of them. So make sure that if you&#8217;re here you don&#8217;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:43] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m gonna pause you there because I don&#8217;t know what that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:46] Marieke van de Rakt: You don&#8217;t know what stroopwafels are?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:49] Nathan Wrigley: No</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:50] Marieke van de Rakt:You can have like a lot of them because we don&#8217;t bring them back anymore. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:52] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah. So stroopwafels are cookies, are waffles with sort of a caramel in between. And they are delicious. That&#8217;s that just says it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] Nathan Wrigley: In the brief time that I&#8217;ve been around the auditorium, you win in terms of t-shirt density.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:11] Marieke van de Rakt: I saw the same thing. I think a lot of companies don&#8217;t give their employees, t-shirts to wear or different ones. We also, because I have a new one actually Taco but it&#8217;s exactly the same color, so it matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:23] Nathan Wrigley: And there&#8217;s nobody with the purple, so it genuinely stands out. But it also means, I think, that you bring a big team. Which also tells me that you&#8217;ve got a big team. 140, something like that? And I was looking earlier today at the stats for contributions in the version 6.0 of WordPress. Automattic, always the big circle and then there&#8217;s companies, which are vying for second, third. And it always seems like Yoast is number two by a long way. Is that a big part of the Yoast system? Do you encourage your team to contribute and all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:58] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah, so we have a Core team. That&#8217;s four people working full time on WordPress Core. And that&#8217;s a big part. We also host internal contributor days. Well, actually we&#8217;ve opened them up to the community. So everyone can join remotely, or at the office nowadays. One of the reasons why you&#8217;re seeing so many of the purple shirts today is because our entire team is signed up for contributor day, and everyone is contributing to WordPress today. So probably you&#8217;ll see more brands and, and more colors tomorrow, but bringing people to contributor day is definitely a part of who we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:35] Marieke van de Rakt: It&#8217;s what got us started. So we are really invested in making WordPress better, because that&#8217;s just what we&#8217;ve been doing from even before Yoast was a company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:44] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s been an exceptional commitment though. It&#8217;s not an ordinary commitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:48] Marieke van de Rakt: I think so, too. So I, I&#8217;m really glad you&#8217;re saying that. We have an exceptional commitment to making that better. And I think more companies should follow that lead because that way we can really make it better together. So we can bitch with each other about what should be better, or we can just sit down and make sure the work gets done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:08] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. It&#8217;s been a busy couple of years for Yoast. Obviously there&#8217;s been the pandemic. Presumably you had to figure out what the office looked like or didn&#8217;t look like and what zoom calls you were gonna foist on people and so on and so forth. You mentioned that you&#8217;re back to the office a bit. But apart from all of that, there&#8217;s been quite a lot of personnel change, especially recently. Joost as in Joost, the man not the product, has changed roles. You&#8217;ve changed roles. Taco has got a new role. I saw a photo the other day with several people who&#8217;ve got new roles. Tell us a little bit about that. What brought that about, and then maybe we&#8217;ll get into the acquisition piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:42] Marieke van de Rakt: Yeah. Well, because that was the trigger. I think about a year before we had the acquisition, we started the process. I already knew that I wouldn&#8217;t want to be the CEO of the company anymore. I think that role is really, it&#8217;s a really heavy one, and it&#8217;s also a very public one, and it&#8217;s just been tough. And COVID was tough. So, when we decided to sell, I already knew that I wouldn&#8217;t want to be the CEO of the company anymore, but I still wanted to work there. But go back to a role I had before I was the CEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think the acquisition got us all into that change process. So the first thing was that I announced that I wasn&#8217;t going to be the CEO. Now, Joost is an advisor. Omar left. Our CTO, well, I just texted him that I really miss him. But I also understand we&#8217;ve been doing this for quite some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joost himself got a bit bored, not with WordPress though, but with SEO, and wants to do other things as well. And is currently experienced a lot of FOMO he said. But he&#8217;ll be here tomorrow. So he&#8217;ll be on Friday. He said to me, oh, you&#8217;re all contributing and I&#8217;m just writing a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, those things changed, and I&#8217;m really excited because we, um, we now have room for new people to grow because you could see Yoast as this big old oak, and that&#8217;s good and that&#8217;s solid. But it also takes away the sun for other trees to grow. So now it&#8217;s the time for at least within Yoast, to have new talent and new leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:17] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Okay, so just sticking to the top tier management, just run us through the changes. Who&#8217;s now in? Who&#8217;s got those key top tier jobs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:25] Taco Verdonschot: So I think that list should always start with Thijs, our CEO. He took over that role from Marieke, I think last year, October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] Marieke van de Rakt: Somewhere like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:35] Taco Verdonschot: Around that time, and then as of April this year we had the bigger change, that we introduced a seven people leadership team. So that&#8217;s obviously Marieke as head of strategy. That&#8217;s Chaya as chief operations officer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:51] Marieke van de Rakt: She was already also in the old board. She came in COVID time. So this is her first WordCamp. She was with us for quite some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:58] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah, and then there&#8217;s four new names, and that&#8217;s Irene on the R and D side. Inge on the marketing side. Herre for all the technical stuff. And me as a head of relations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:12] Marieke van de Rakt: And those four have been working with us for more than five years. All of them. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:16] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah. All of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:17] Nathan Wrigley: So if we rewind the clock about five years, it feels like nobody was being acquired in WordPress. It was all very quiet. And then about four years ago it began. And then two years ago it was really, there was a daily news cycle of somebody&#8217;s been bought in the WordPress space. And then you came in and I must admit I follow the WordPress news pretty closely. I didn&#8217;t see that one coming. Tell us how that came about. How far do we need to go back before the dates that it was announced, when all the negotiations started, and why you mentioned that Yoast himself was getting a bit bored. But for other reasons, I&#8217;m sure as well, why did that process begin? And how long was that process?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:54] Marieke van de Rakt: So we talked to parties before just because you get a lot of questions. So it&#8217;s not that we never thought about a possible acquisition or funding before. But we&#8217;re totally bootstraped, and I think Christmas 2020, so the first COVID Christmas, that was when Joost and I decided we should sell or get major funding. And the major reason was that COVID got us scared. We were doing great but it was so much work. We sell in dollars, so we make money in dollars, but all of our costs are in euros. And that makes you very vulnerable for the exchange rate of the dollar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t control. And with a hundred, I don&#8217;t know 125 people on your payroll, the responsibility was weighing heavily on both of us, and that&#8217;s just something that we didn&#8217;t want to do anymore. So then we hired, we hired a banker actually. Someone who helps you to sell your company. And we&#8217;ve talked to a lot of, well, the usual suspects. Then decided eventually to sell to Newfold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] Nathan Wrigley: So what was it about the offer that they presented, which said, okay, that&#8217;s it, the green light over there. Was there something in particular? Were there any red lines that you presented to them? Right, this cannot happen, if we&#8217;re gonna sell to anybody. Yeah, just that kind of idea. What were the things that gave the green light to them and not to others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:19] Marieke van de Rakt: So when we were selling, we thought about three things. We thought about ourselves. What&#8217;s good for us. And then we thought about what&#8217;s good for Yoast the company, and what&#8217;s good for WordPress. So we wouldn&#8217;t sell to a company that would just do things that would be bad for WordPress. And we won&#8217;t sell to a company that would say you have fire half of your staff or something like that. So would be good for our employees. It would be a good fit for WordPress. And I think the offer of Newfold, Newfold wanted to buy us because of our commitments in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they were impressed with our WordPress Core team. They wanted to do more in WordPress and, so them inquiring us was part of their mission to show we love WordPress, which is the best reason to buy us, I think. And I thought their leadership was really diverse. And I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of boards and they&#8217;re mostly male and white and a bit gray, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with people that are male and white and gray. But it&#8217;s nice to see some diversity in that. Well Newfold Digital is led by a woman. I&#8217;m really impressed by her. So that was at least, for me personally, a big reason to choose for them as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:33] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s a name which doesn&#8217;t roll off the tongue. What I mean by that is, you know, everybody&#8217;s heard of Yoast, everybody&#8217;s heard of Automattic, but maybe not so much Newfold Digital. Can you just tell the listeners which bits of Newfold Digital may we have heard of before? Because I know they&#8217;re a company which are behind other companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:48] Marieke van de Rakt: They only exist for like a year and a half now and they&#8217;ve been combined. So the Endurance group, which Blue Host is the biggest brand. And then you have the web dot com side, but that&#8217;s not a WordPress side. And those two companies were combined into Newfold Digital, and they only existed like a half year and then they acquired Yoast. So it&#8217;s a really new brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of job stability and all of those kind of things, you mentioned that that was an important part. How&#8217;s that going,? Have roles changed? Has the company still got the same focus that it had a year ago? Well, let&#8217;s not say a year, six months ago, or have you noticed any changes and I&#8217;m firing this one at Taco.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:27] Taco Verdonschot: So yes, there have been changes due to what we just described in, in changing in leadership, but in terms of direction of the company, it&#8217;s not that Newfold comes in and says, Hey, you need to go left or you need to go right. For exactly what Marieke just told, is they bought us for what we do and who we are. That&#8217;s still true today. So they kept their word from that whole process and are still supporting us in being Yoast and offering SEO for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have there been changes in the company in the last six months? Yes, we, we are slowly changing. The workforce landscape is changing, and we&#8217;re changing with it. But nothing forced by the acquisition. This would&#8217;ve happened anyway if we weren&#8217;t sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:14] Marieke van de Rakt: Ah, and nobody left after the acquisition for a few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:17] Taco Verdonschot: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:18] Marieke van de Rakt: So that wasn&#8217;t related to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] Marieke van de Rakt: I think the biggest change was just that the office is opened up again. And so everything&#8217;s different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:26] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of how the company can behave, the inflow of money I presume, you mentioned payroll and how concerning that was. Does that kind of thing evaporate a little bit more? Do you need to worry it a little bit less about payroll, because that&#8217;s now worried about somewhere further up the food chain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:42] Marieke van de Rakt: For me that&#8217;s changed dramatically. So I used to look at the sales every day. I think Joost would look at it every hour, and see if it&#8217;s all going well and that changed, and that gave us a lot of… I was talking to Joshua Strebel, who of course also sold and to like, taking a coat off, that&#8217;s what it is. It&#8217;s taking a coat off, and I still feel a huge responsibility of getting that company with new leadership into a stable, good new path, but it&#8217;s different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:11] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah. The funny thing is for me, it&#8217;s quite the opposite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:14] Marieke van de Rakt: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:14] Taco Verdonschot: Because before, Marieke and the rest of the board would take away all those financial concerns from even the highest management level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:25] Marieke van de Rakt: That wasn&#8217;t the best idea though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:26] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:26] Marieke van de Rakt: We did that. We never told anybody about our financial stress. We were doing great, but we were experiencing, oh, we have to grow, and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:34] Taco Verdonschot: That was really something that was kept away, and now with, my new role, I&#8217;m suddenly seeing all the numbers and seeing what the numbers mean and how they influence decisions that we&#8217;re making in the company and vice versa, how decisions are influencing our, our revenue stream or our cost. And that&#8217;s a whole new world. So, for me, I&#8217;m looking more at numbers and for you, it&#8217;s obviously with less worry than before. Yeah, we, we found common ground now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:05] Nathan Wrigley: Two years ago, or whenever it was 2019, if we&#8217;d have had this same interview, we would&#8217;ve been talking about Yoast SEO and nothing more. But now we can talk about Shopify. That&#8217;s a big change. A giant of a platform. Just give us the theory behind why Shopify? Why not, I don&#8217;t know something else like Drupal, or some other thing like Squarespace? Is that product receiving the same care and attention, shall we say as the WordPress side? Do you have any plans to go into other CMSs, maybe SaaS products, like I said, Wix and Squarespace and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to release any of that valuable information if you don&#8217;t want to of course. But tell us about the Shopify thing first. Whoever wants to take that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:43] Marieke van de Rakt: We have a TYPO3 extension, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:45] Taco Verdonschot: Yes and Neos as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:47] Marieke van de Rakt: So we, we had some before, but we, as a pact internally would say that we wouldn&#8217;t do any non open source CMSs, but still we are doing Shopify. So we made the decision, partly because we wanted to be less dependent on WordPress, because although we love WordPress, it&#8217;s very scary if you bet all your money on one thing. So it could be a wise business decision to go into Shopify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They asked us to come. So Shopify wanted to improve their SEO so they worked together with us. They asked us can you build Yoast SEO for Shopify? So that was a big reason, and their core values are pretty aligned with us. So that was the thing. Okay, we&#8217;re going to let go of the open source part because they&#8217;re really for the small businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s either Amazon because that&#8217;s how people sell, but at least on Shopify, you have your own website, your own store, and that&#8217;s really important. So that&#8217;s why I think why we decided Shopify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:44] Taco Verdonschot: And I think it&#8217;s the close source system or SaaS that comes closest to the open source mindset, because it really supports the small businesses, and you can get started super easily on Shopify and anyone and everyone can start a shop. And that is different for a lot of other systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:06] Marieke van de Rakt: And it&#8217;s growing like crazy. So it&#8217;s also a really good business opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:10] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I have no insight into how that&#8217;s going. So it is growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] Marieke van de Rakt: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:16] Nathan Wrigley: Are you growing with it? Is it taking you along for the ride? Basically, has it been a good move?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] Marieke van de Rakt: Well, We&#8217;ve built the thing ourselves, which is a lot of work because Shopify isn&#8217;t WordPress. we&#8217;ve launched it. We had a successful launch, but we&#8217;re not as well known in the Shopify world yet. So we&#8217;re growing gradually and that sounds like bad news, but I love that because that&#8217;s what we want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s so much fun. We&#8217;re celebrating every five star review we get. So we have a dedicated Shopify team and they&#8217;re so excited to get people to like our product, but Shopify just works a little differently and you can&#8217;t paste your WordPress product over it. So we&#8217;re tweaking it and it gets better every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:55] Taco Verdonschot: Every single day. So the good thing about our Shopify app is that it fully is a SaaS which means that were not bound to releases that people then have to install. And if we decide to push something, it&#8217;s live right now. That&#8217;s a very big difference compared to WordPress, where you&#8217;re relying on people to install your updates and to actually keep their site up to date, et cetera. So it&#8217;s a really different way of developing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:25] Marieke van de Rakt: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:26] Nathan Wrigley: Marika. You&#8217;ve got a, I was gonna say a talk, but it&#8217;s not. You&#8217;ve got a panel. Just tell us what this panel&#8217;s about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:31] Marieke van de Rakt: This panel is about acquisitions and WordPress. I&#8217;m just going to sit there and if they ask me a question then they&#8217;ll answer. I think a lot of people want to know, the ins and outs of what happens and what does this mean for WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] Nathan Wrigley: SEO in general. What is going on in the future? I&#8217;ve been seeing quite a lot coming out of the Google verse. Awful lot of people talking about things like AI content and whether or not that&#8217;s gonna be squashed. What do we need to be mindful of in the next 12 months in terms of SEO?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:58] Marieke van de Rakt: I think the main thing Google does is wanting to present the best result to the user. So if you&#8217;re stable in SEO and just create good content, AI or not AI because it just has to be good. And there are really good AI tools out there, but it should be something your reader will want to read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not just something you, nobody wants to read. That&#8217;s not serving anyone. That&#8217;s the thing you need to do. But at the same time on the technical side, we are really looking at what Google is doing. So then you need to just install Yoast SEO, because we&#8217;ll make sure to get the latest technical stuff in there. So the way Google crawls and stuff, we&#8217;re really mindful of that. But I think a normal user wouldn&#8217;t be able to adapt that in a website settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:42] Nathan Wrigley: I have this concern that we&#8217;re gonna be creating content with AI, which is then in turn, the sole purpose of that is to be consumed by Google&#8217;s AI. And it&#8217;s like this cyclical effect where…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:55] Marieke van de Rakt: But then you&#8217;re doing it wrong way because you should always create content for a user. Yeah. And I am a writer. So I am not particularly fan of AI created content, but I have to be honest, sometimes it&#8217;s pretty good. But it should be original content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you should at least insert enough information in your AI that it&#8217;s an original thought, because an artificial intelligence can never come up with something new. It&#8217;s always something that&#8217;s already out there. So make sure you write something that people want to read. That&#8217;s the only advice that I can give you. Maybe Google won&#8217;t be the only search engine out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are all kinds of rumors that Apple is doing stuff and rolling out his own search engine. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s true, but that&#8217;s something that could happen as well. Google doesn&#8217;t have to be the only, Yoast SEO isn&#8217;t the only SEO plugin. Google doesn&#8217;t have to necessarily be the only search engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:50] Nathan Wrigley: Is that what you focus most of your energy though, because presumably if there is an Apple SEO search page, your work then sort of doubles because you&#8217;ve got to try and figure out their algorithm as well as the Google algorithm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:02] Marieke van de Rakt: They&#8217;re probably doing the same thing. It&#8217;s the same with Bing and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:05] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah, in the end they have the same goal. They want to answer a user&#8217;s question. So in order to do that, you need that good content. If you want to rank first, you need to be the best result. That&#8217;s basically it. Regardless of which search engine you use to find that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:23] Marieke van de Rakt: Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun though? I would get excited again with SEO, if there would be a different kind. Maybe a privacy more minded kind, because that would be awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] Nathan Wrigley: Have you heard of a search engine called Kagi? K A G I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:36] Marieke van de Rakt: I haven&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:38] Nathan Wrigley: Do you remember ManageWP? It is created by him. It&#8217;s in beta only at the moment. And it&#8217;s gonna be a paid for search engine and you&#8217;ll pay them a hundred dollars a year, something along those lines, for no tracking. So the gamble is that you pay. It&#8217;s actually really interesting. K A G I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So what are you gonna do over the next couple of days, the pair of you? What are you hoping to get out of this specific event? Who are you gonna go and see? What things are you excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:03] Taco Verdonschot: So we made a great start yesterday evening. There was a party by Pagely, and it was on a, on a boat, with so many people and a lot of familiar faces that we hadn&#8217;t seen in three years. And that&#8217;s going to continue because over the course of this event, we&#8217;ll see our old friends and meet a lot of new friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:23] Marieke van de Rakt: Interesting conversations with possible partners. It&#8217;s exciting to meet our Bluehost new colleagues and our Yith colleagues who are all part of the Newfold family, so that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m looking forward to as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I am looking forward to talking to actual customers because I use WordCamps to talk to customers and ask them why they like our product and what they dislike. And, well, I haven&#8217;t done that for ages, so only with people in our local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:51] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;ve got a feeling I know what the answer to this question is. In 2023 WordCamp Europe, wherever that may be, will you be back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:57] Taco Verdonschot: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:58] Marieke van de Rakt: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:59] Nathan Wrigley: Taco, Marieke, thanks for talking to me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:01] Taco Verdonschot: Thank you so much for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:03] Marieke van de Rakt: Thank you.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Designers Explore Adding Configuration Options to Block Editor Onboarding Modal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-designers-explore-adding-configuration-options-to-block-editor-onboarding-modal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3615:\"<p>Gutenberg designers are considering replacing the current welcome guide modal with a new onboarding screen that prompts users to configure some of the editor&#8217;s many individual preference settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The existing welcome setup was designed during the earlier days of the block editor when many WordPress users were experiencing it for the first time. It briefly introduces users to the concept of blocks and invites them to customize them. The editor has matured since this welcome guide was created and it could use an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />The existing welcome guide\n\n\n\n<p>The editor is now loaded with more settings for personalizing the content creation experience, such as document toolbar placement and accessibility features, that users may not ever discover on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To create an editing experience that feels intuitive, folks will often need to tailor these settings based on their individual preferences and needs,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored designer James Koster said in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/04/design-exploration-encourage-editor-configuration-during-on-boarding/\">a post on the Make Design blog</a>. &#8220;There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Instead of relying on people to find these settings on their own (admittedly they’re a little scattered, but that’s another issue), it might be good to surface them during onboarding. Consequently, users can set up a comfy editing experience straight-away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koster is proposing users configure these settings when getting started with the editor for the first time. He shared a video demonstrating how that might look. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The modal is much bigger than the existing welcome guide. It is also more interactive. When users mouse over the options in the left side, it shows a preview in the right side of the modal. The following user preferences are included in Koster&#8217;s prototype:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>document toolbar display</li><li> the block toolbar</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42399\">text formatting tools</a></li><li>accessibility options for toolbar button display, editor styles, and block keyboard navigation</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The first screen of the modal allows users to skip the setup and go straight to writing. This will be useful for those who do not care to configure any user preferences or those who are in a hurry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koster posted the proposal a couple weeks ago, asking whether it is a good idea in the first place, but hasn&#8217;t received much critical feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the larger modal is an improvement on the existing welcome guide, but will it be overwhelming to users who are brand new to the block editor? Will it even make sense to them? A certain level of familiarity with the block editor is required to have any context for the editor customization options. An onboarding wizard with a lot of new terms could take a psychological toll on new users. It&#8217;s a lot to take in before getting started in the editor. Are these preferences so important that they need to be the first thing users see when they open the editor? Something like this will need some real user testing before it makes its way to millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koster and the Gutenberg design contributors are still looking for feedback on the project.

&nbsp;Automattic-sponsored WordPress marketing team contributor Nicholas Garofalo <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/a-new-wordpress-org-homepage-and-download-page/\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The new download page greets visitors with a new layout that makes getting started with WordPress even easier by presenting both the download and hosting options right at the top.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Download page now clearly offers two paths at the top &#8211; buttons for downloading and installing WordPress, and hosting recommendations for setting  it up through a hosting provider. It also includes help getting started with resources linked further down the page WordPress courses, developer resources, support, and user forums.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Although the designs have received overwhelmingly positive feedback, their journey to development was not without a few bumps in the road. When the Meta team published an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2022/08/01/developing-the-redesigned-home-and-download-pages/\">update</a> about taking the designs into development, less than three weeks from the design kickoff, Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s criticism of the pace of the project drew the ire of some community members who were offended by the interaction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is not a good use of time, nor does it further the actual goals of a new homepage or download page, and we have better places to spend our development time,&#8221; Mullenweg said in response to the plans to create a block theme for the new designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note that the person he is responding to here is working in capacity as a volunteer, sponsored (employed) by Automattic.

Mullenweg contended that turning Figma designs into a theme should have taken far less time to launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;On the &#8216;hours not weeks&#8217; to implement — it’s such a basic layout, it’s hard to imagine it taking a single person more than a day on Squarespace, Wix, Webflow, or one of the WP page builders,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So, if we’re just doing a prettier version of the same thing, make those changes in place with the existing code approach quickly and move on to something higher value. If you are trying to further WP itself, you need a fundamentally different approach.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some interpreted these comments as a referendum on the block editor&#8217;s usability. The development plan Shiels outlined included the creation of custom blocks in order to launch an MVP of the new theme. This called into question whether the block editor is delivering on its &#8220;dream it, build it&#8221; promises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The&nbsp;core&nbsp;team has to&nbsp;edit the core blocks&nbsp;for such&nbsp;a simple layout&nbsp;– after 2+ years, what should ordinary users/developers expect?&#8221; WordPress developer Aleksandar Perisic commented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Dog-fooding is needed just as much as code-focused contributions right now,&#8221; WP Engine software engineer Mike McAlister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemcalister/status/1557850870338945025\">said</a>. &#8220;One informs the other. I’ve been knee deep in FSE for months and honestly it doesn’t feel like anyone has tried to make a REAL site with this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to giving WordPress.org a fresh coat of paint, the project has sparked a larger conversation about how challenging it still is to build out simple designs with the block editor, even for the people who make WordPress. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 01:29:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WPTavern: Newsletter Glue Closes Free Plugin on WordPress.org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=136969\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/newsletter-glue-closes-free-plugin-on-wordpress-org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4649:\"<p>The creators of <a href=\"https://newsletterglue.com/\">Newsletter Glue</a> have <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/newsletter-glue/\">removed their free plugin from WordPress.org </a>in favor of focusing on the commercial version. The plugin streamlines the publishing workflow for newsletter authors who also publish to their WordPress sites. It includes blocks and patterns for email templates and subscriber forms. Five months ago the plugin&#8217;s authors warned users that they would be closing the free version and would no longer be updating it as of May 1, but the process of removing it was delayed until today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-founder Lesley Sim <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza/status/1559092795004317696\">announced</a> the plugin&#8217;s closure on Twitter and shared a few valuable lessons for WordPress product businesses looking to use WordPress.org as a their primary distribution channel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We made a bunch of noob mistakes in the way we set up free vs paid,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;Which made the customer upgrade flow kind of weird. I think it could&#8217;ve worked. We just didn&#8217;t set it up right, and it just doesn&#8217;t make sense to fix it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of closure, the free Newsletter Glue plugin had approximately 200 active installations, which seems low for a growing commercial plugin. This is because the free version got uninstalled when a user upgraded to pro, so it was never a good representation of how many people were using the product. Sim said Newsletter Glue wasn&#8217;t growing the free user base and &#8220;it was just sitting there like a dead tree stump.&#8221; The company had not updated it in over a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We stupidly set it such that when a user upgrades, they install the pro version and the free version automatically uninstalls,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;So we lost free active users as a &#8216;reward&#8217; for new conversions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This architectural choice meant that WordPress.org wasn&#8217;t bringing the product a significant flow of traffic and prospective upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A year ago, we simply didn&#8217;t have enough features to make good decisions on what to put in the free versus pro,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;So we went from having all our integrations on the free plugin to gating some integrations instead. I think this was a poor decision and led to our install count instantly stagnating. This could have been reversed, so I don&#8217;t think this was a key reason. But it was an instigating reason to begin considering removing the plugin from the repo since it was no longer bringing us traffic and installs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite not finding WordPress.org a good source of traffic for the product, Sim said the decision to close was not easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Here are some things we lost out on:&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;1) Biggest distribution channel in WP. 2) Easy way for reviewers to check out the plugin for free without having to contact me. 3) Source of credibility (reviews).&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current users can still use the free plugin but it will not be getting updates anymore. In lieu of a free plugin, Newsletter Glue is offering a test drive option where users can try it on a demo site before purchasing. The company has taken a unique path to becoming a commercial plugin that is fully independently distributed.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I hate the free to paid user experience on the WP directory with a passion,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;We had a full standalone pro plugin so the upgrade flow was really clunky. We&#8217;d get users using the free version emailing us saying, &#8216;I&#8217;ve just upgraded, but I don&#8217;t see any pro features on my site. What&#8217;s wrong?&#8217; I also had some wonderful customers who would upgrade then continue using the free version for over a year, not even realizing they were on the free version.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing focusing exclusively on promoting the commercial product, the Newsletter Glue team is now free of the burden of supporting customers transitioning from the free version. The trade-off is missing out on exposure on WordPress.org. It&#8217;s an approach that works for the company at this stage but may not be suitable to other new products without strong marketing in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Unless you already have experience marketing a plugin from scratch AND you have a good go to market plan, I think the default choice should be to be on the [WordPress] repo,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;Just make sure you set up the commercial part of your plugin correctly so that it makes sense.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 20:19:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WordPress.org blog: A New WordPress.org Homepage and Download Page\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13321\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/a-new-wordpress-org-homepage-and-download-page/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7724:\"<p>The WordPress experience has significantly evolved in the past few years.

It&#8217;s a utility plugin that Christopher has had on his mind since before he released its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/hierarchy-plugin-enhances-wordpress-as-a-cms\">Hierarchy</a> plugin, eight years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress Admin felt really disjointed once Custom Post Types were a new thing (this is how long ago we&#8217;re talking) because there were top level content &#8216;buckets&#8217; mixed and matched with Plugins and Settings and everything else,&#8221; Christopher said. &#8220;Then products started using the Admin Menu as a form of advertising to an extent, putting top level Menu items in place when they absolutely aren&#8217;t necessary, and the problem just got worse and worse.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christopher aimed to tackle this same problem with OrganizeWP but redesigned the UI and rebuilt it with JavaScript to accommodate new features like groups and drag and drop. The new product is now out of beta and is catching some attention due to its unusual <a href=\"https://organizewp.com/checkout/\">pricing</a> model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For $29.00, users get access to updates and support for Version 2. OrganizeWP is selling licenses for the current major version with no subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post titled <a href=\"https://jonchristopher.us/blog/rethinking-wordpress-product-pricing-models/\">Rethinking WordPress Product Pricing Models</a>, Christopher highlights the drawbacks of using the subscription model, which is used widely in the WordPress ecosystem for software products that users host on their own websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Support, I would argue, is&nbsp;<em>by far</em>&nbsp;the reason so many WordPress products have adopted a subscription-based pricing model,&#8221; Christopher said. &#8220;The support burden for products in the WordPress space is&nbsp;<strong>hugely significant</strong>. It goes hand-in-hand with the self-sufficiency that comes with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We run into problems when the platform relies on self-sufficiency but the customer is not self-sufficient.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Since OrganizeWP is an admin-facing tool with no frontend output, Christopher decided it was &#8220;a prime candidate for a more old school software pricing model in that licenses will be sold for each major version, with no automatic expiration.&#8221; He plans to support version 2 of OrganizeWP indefinitely in terms of compatibility with WordPress and bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With heavily committing to major versions being the big planning milestones, updates will involve (primarily) bug fixes when applicable as opposed to adding new features,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Each major version will be feature frozen, so the updates will look a bit different when compared to most WordPress products today.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christopher identified subscription fatigue as the inspiration for this pricing model experiment. One might be hard pressed to build any type of business website on WordPress without purchasing any subscriptions for plugins. Users are so inundated with subscriptions that MasterWP was inspired to create <a href=\"https://wpwallet.com/\">WP Wallet</a>, a service that helps users keep track of license renewals and helps agencies bill for client subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fellow veteran product creator Brian Gardner called OrganizeWP&#8217;s pricing model &#8220;a bold (and refreshing) move,&#8221; but it&#8217;s the market that will decide if it is successful. Will customers be grateful for purchasing the plugin as a one-time payment or will they expect a constant stream of new features for the price?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The market may say that WordPress product customers have come to know, expect, and be comfortable with the subscription model,&#8221; Christopher said. &#8220;Selling major versions means that updates will be nothing more than maintenance releases and bug fixes, no new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;New major versions will need to be&nbsp;<em>pitched</em>&nbsp;to existing customers and that feeling of getting features &#8216;for free&#8217; is gone with this pricing model. Customers may&nbsp;<em>hate</em>&nbsp;that, I’m not sure yet.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 21:30:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce to Stop Registering Customizer Options in Upcoming 6.9 Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=136922\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-to-stop-registering-customizer-options-in-upcoming-6-9-release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2480:\"<p>WooCommerce is making a strong push towards getting the Customizer menu out of the admin for those who are using a block theme. In an effort to clean up the admin and eliminate confusion, the plugin will <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/08/11/stop-registering-customizer-options-for-block-themes/\">stop registering Customizer options when a block theme is active</a> beginning with version 6.9.

Developers can opt to use the <code>customize_register</code> action to include Customizer menu items, but continuing to offer Customizer options is not an ideal user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Subpanels or sections registered within the WooCommerce panel on the Customizer will no longer be accessible since the Customizer links will be removed,&#8221; WooCommerce engineer Alba Rincón said in the announcement. &#8220;If you’re the developer of a theme or extension that relies on the presence of these you will need to make changes to ensure a smooth transition.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce core developers recommend plugin authors update their products to relocate any Customizer settings to a block, pattern, or the Global Styles menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community developers are also invited to weigh in on a change that may impact developers&#8217; debugging workflows.

Big thanks to <strong>David Bisset</strong> in his former role as host and curator here, and also to our intern and post-production engineer, <strong>Olivia Bisset</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">This week we\'re talking about pay transparency. Ny relates some personal experiences where an employer did not disclose pay or how employees were selected for raises. This leads us into a discussion of pay transparency in the hiring process — how it matters to everyone but especially job seekers who are black, indigenous, or other people of color. (Ny <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is-why-we-need-pay-transparency-in-tech/\">has written about this before</a>, and <strong>Piccia Neri</strong> has been investigating the topic lately.) We also talk about how a lack of transparency can seem to emphasize an employer\'s distrust and an employee\'s disadvantaged position — and the effect that can have on workplace culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/techtwitter?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#techtwitter</a> & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> Twitter & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/womenintech?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#womenintech</a>, there\'s still time to vote in this poll! <br /><br />No salary range in job adverts: yay or nay? <a href=\"https://t.co/p1nRvnGGCB\">https://t.co/p1nRvnGGCB</a></p>&mdash; Piccia Neri (@Piccia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Piccia/status/1557682199067037696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 11, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we talk about our own family histories which are touched — in living memory in Ny\'s case — by slavery and colonialism where work and dignity were extracted from some people by others with the power take their labor without compensation. Ny\'s great grandfather was born a slave in South Carolina in 1858 and lived until 1963. Dan\'s ancestors include German settlers in North Carolina who abandoned their earlier beliefs against slavery and began to practice it in the late 1700s. In the Americas and beyond, the past is much closer than we often assume, especially for BIPOC people. History only &#8220;bends toward justice&#8221; if people choose to bend it that way. It can also go the other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we close with how <strong>Allie Nimmons</strong> experienced a surprising level of hostility to a survey she presented to the WordPress community about the ways we contribute to the project and how we feel about it. There\'s the community we have now — and the community we need to become. How do we get there? What are the barriers? How can you help?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-41 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"StellarWP\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-39 wp-block-column\">\n<h3 class=\"StellarWP\" id=\"Sponsor\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/stellarwp\">StellarWP</a><a href=\"https://poststat.us/wpengine\"></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>StellarWP</strong> provides WordPress solutions for all humankind.

Pretty good. Good to see you again. so what\'s on your mind in world of WordPress this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Pay transparency. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Okay. Me too. Yeah. So peach and Mary, um, who\'s, uh, I think pretty well known and post status member, um, proposed this some time ago and I\'ve been, you know, kind of encouraging and helping along towards an article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we know that we do job listings and there\'s always, there are things around. Time zones and where people specify they want people to be from or language that sometimes need a little nudging about [00:01:00] appropriateness, um, for being inclusive, but probably the single most vexing thing to people is, um, a reasonable pay for positions in a field that tends to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhat underpaid where we want to bring that up. Um, but you know, as in most job listings, LinkedIn, anywhere, a lot of employers just won\'t pay post any salary at all. And there may be kind of vagueness about, is this a senior position entry level? And yeah, what\'s the compensation. Some companies are really awesome about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but some are vague to just don\'t don\'t mention it. Mm-hmm so, um, So she was surveying. Yeah. What did you think of her, her poll and the discussion that happened on Twitter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I thought it was really good. Um, I actually wrote, um, for master WP a little while ago about pay [00:02:00] transparency and how more companies need to just post their salaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, of course it gets pushed back, not my article, but that idea gets pushed back from companies, especially in places like South Carolina where, you know, They really do want to discriminate and pay and not care about it. Um, but I thought it was excellent and I think more companies should do it. Also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanna point out that Colorado already has a state law that does this. And, um, one interesting thing about that is so many companies have been major companies like Southwest airlines have been trying to, can I name. Oh, yeah. Okay. they, um, you know, they\'re one of the people to fight against it and the companies are like trying to like take the jobs out of Colorado.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I think it was Southwest. Let me not slander Southwest. And it\'s not them. I\'m gonna double check</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> because they\'re so embarrassed about their salary. They don\'t wanna have to post it. I mean, you\'ll leave the state cuz of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Like I feel like, but that, and also they want to pay people differently. [00:03:00] Like yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So they don\'t wanna be seen doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. Like they know it\'s wrong. So like they know it\'s wrong. They know it\'s not the right thing to do, but they\'re still going to do it. And it\'s just come on, man. It\'s 2022. But like we were talking about, we\'re not that removed from first of all. Well, a lot of discrimination still happens today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s undeniable, but we\'re not that removed from legalized discrimination. Mm-hmm . Yeah. And I think a lot of companies, you know, we don\'t have a federal law to make you post, um, your salaries, but we need to one, um, two, a lot of companies don\'t know how much. Better. It makes them look, if they go ahead and do that, just jump ahead of the curve and have those salaries up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people know like we\'re getting paid, what we\'re worth one. We\'re not wasting our time with the interview. We don\'t want the pay and we\'re not being discriminated against by color, race, [00:04:00] gender, sexuality, things like that. Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So I think, um, it\'s gonna be interesting to see how, how PT develops that, how we pull that article together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe I\'ll, I\'ll have to get, get you in on that too, for some feedback, or maybe some, some quotes too. Uh, have you had experiences directly with where you applied for, for something not quite knowing what the range was cause they didn\'t tell you or do you have personal rule about like, I\'m not gonna look at that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, yeah. Um, so living in South Carolina, almost most of my life, um, it\'s a state that doesn\'t have a lot of, um, protection for employees, a very anti-union state. Um, I remember, um, working in college for a, I\'m not gonna name, drop them. Um, I don\'t want them to get the attention, um, working for a company where I made food and delivered it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, they told us when we were first hired, they were like, you [00:05:00] know, We\'re open about this and I\'m like, oh, it\'s gonna be something positive. And I\'m like, what are you hoping about? Well, uh, raises are given at the discretion of managers. So, you know, mm we\'re just gonna let you know. I\'m like, why were you so excited to tell me that, that, that sucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you don\'t like me, I don\'t get a raise. Yep. But they were like, well, at least we told you, we didn\'t just like do it like that. Doesn\'t make it better, but they thought it made it better. And, um, I worked at that job for a little while and. Uh, personal story. So I, I don\'t, I haven\'t told the story a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think publicly, um, our manager was very sweet, very sweet guy and, um, very personable. I had no issues with him and I remember one day he asked if I wanted to come to his house and like, just hang out and like, I didn\'t think anything of it, but I was busy. I wasn\'t gonna do it. like, I was like 20 at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\'t really care. I was like, um, oh no, I\'m I\'m busy. And he was like, oh, okay. Like, I thought it was like a simple conversation. He was like, okay. You know, no worries. And I guess a couple people had, they went and hung out with him one on one. [00:06:00] And I noticed in the next couple of weeks, it was just like a complete personality change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He just like made little side comments about working with me. Um, like I said, oh, you\'re on the line with Naisha today. Ugh. Okay. I guess. Nice, you know, I\'m joking. And I\'m like, what? And I didn\'t think of it at the time. I was just like, whatever, I\'m in college, like I\'m taking like four, like 20 credits and I\'m doing the shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part-time, I\'m not gonna think about it. But, um, I remember like in the next few weeks, like people who were getting hired on after me, cuz I help open the store. Um, they had raises. They got their 25 cents, which was a big deal at the time, I guess. And, um, a couple of them that I trained, they became like managers and supervisors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was sitting there with my $7 and doing all this work for nothing. And when I quit that job, you know, some of the guys were telling me, cuz it was mostly a, a guy job that they hired and then they rarely hire people of color. Um, they were like, you know, you really should have, uh, been nicer to. So and so, and I was like, [00:07:00] they were like, yeah, we used to hang out and do all the stuff that cover in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You never wanted to do it. Yeah. What. . I was like, that guy asked me one time when I first started to come to this house. I said, no, and that\'s why y\'all wouldn\'t pay me or promote me. Yeah. So I was like, you know, I was done with that company. I, I don\'t even eat their food to this day. Um, and they\'re not doing well as a company either, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, I shouldn\'t say that, but it\'s great to me now. but, um, I just, that was like the first time as an adult. Cause I was 20 or 21, um, that something was so blatantly. That blatantly happened. And it was like, I didn\'t even think until later on I\'m like, what if he, like, would\'ve tried to like touch me or something like, like, I, I didn\'t even think of that at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was just a simple, like, I\'m busy, I\'m in college, I\'m doing all this stuff. Like, dude, we can hang out another time. And it was like, after that, there was this just whole narrative of she\'s mean she doesn\'t wanna do this, deny her money. So I think at a company where there would\'ve been paid transparency, Where you didn\'t rely on [00:08:00] being favored by the boss?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, things like that, that I would\'ve been paid what I was due, which probably still, it was 25 cents more. It wasn\'t, I still think I was worth more than that, but I would\'ve been promoted. I wouldn\'t trained my, you know, replacements in, you know, superiors. Um, so that\'s, I always think about that story when I think about pay transparency because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I was very young and naive and I was, I was naive for a long time and it\'s like, how do we protect other people from that? Not just women, cuz it happens to men, but mostly women. How, how do we protect people of color from that? Like how do we stop that from happening? And I think pay transparency is the first step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. I\'m, I\'m really, um, impressed and pleased that Colorado took that step. And that\'s, that\'s interesting how. Impacts distributed companies with people working remotely employers there, like, like yours, like Rob mm-hmm consulting, um, based [00:09:00] in, in, in Colorado, but teams all over the place. Um, so you\'re kind of benefiting from Colorado is progressive in South Carolina, despite South Carolina.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, nice. This is, this is something we can do in distributed companies to change cultures, to make. Where we see, you know, kinda gross inequities. Um, but yeah. What do you, what do you think, um, what do you think it does to for, I, I think, I think a lot of employers have the great intentions and I\'d stick up for \'em.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, there\'s reason. There\'s plenty of feedback and reasons for why, why we, we want to have this conversation later, or it\'s, it\'s a variable thing, or we don\'t wanna scare people off who we\'d like to get in the role by, um, you know, that\'s kind of a feed, but who\'s time are you, you wasting here [00:10:00] potentially, but yeah, they want to cast the net maybe widely, but there\'s two sides to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, if they really value building. A positive, collegial, collaborative environment that makes their people better as they grow there and is inclusive. Um, what does it do potentially? To start off with this kind of shell game or, you know, what\'s the three card Monty kinda game of how much would you would require her to be paid for this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much do you think you\'re worth? Which is, um, some personalities and some people in certain experiences and some people on a depressing day. I mean, that\'s a hard, you\'re just not gonna represent yourself. Well, and you don\'t have like an advocate at your arm to do this and. What do you, you know, you can tell what I, I think about it, but what, [00:11:00] what are your, what are your thoughts for the long term impact on that company culture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you start off with oh, degree of non-transparency and, and suspicion, or trying to leverage the power, you have to employer side advantage, um, over the employee, um, .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> A lot of people probably won\'t agree with me because this is the status quo, but the world is changing. If companies continue to do that, these mind games, they won\'t have a company you\'re losing good talent because you want to play these mind games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to, I\'m the guy in, not this, I\'m the person in power. I don\'t want to, um, say it\'s only guys that do it, cuz it\'s not only guys, but I\'m the person in power. Let\'s see what let\'s see if I can, uh, how many tricks I can get out of them. before I can get, you know, them in. And then to me, it sets the stage for how it\'s going to be working at [00:12:00] this company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\'m gonna apply into this job with all these mind games and tricks, and I\'m jumping through hoops and I have to make sure it\'s not a joke when he says this or that. And they say this or that. Oh my God, I\'m so sorry. Um, but um, I have to go through all these hoops and then. I\'m stressed out. I\'m like sweating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need the money. I need the job. I get the job. I\'m like, whew. All right. It\'s Monday. What game do I have to play today? So you\'re going to have depressed workers. You\'re gonna have stressed out workers. You\'re gonna have burnt out workers and eventually. Hopefully when they learn their value, they\'re going to quit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think employers can do this, but they\'re gonna have, they\'re gonna have a high turnover rate. They\'re not going to attract the best talent because they\'re, so they\'re just losing so many with that. And the company\'s culture is going to suck as well as the world. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> And I, I kind of appreciate more and more how, um, how, you know, there\'s an interpersonal [00:13:00] ethical level where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re maybe hurting someone in their, you know, immediate lives with, um, with a, a work environment that doesn\'t build them up. And mm-hmm, , um, puts them in a situation where they have to, um, you know, not really know if they\'re at parody with their peers and, and colleagues or what they\'re worth, or, um, and if you damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, there\'s, there\'s a certain amount of human capital that employers just assume, you know, we just produce it, you know, our mm-hmm and it, you know, there\'s a whole, all the people that are holding us up, family, friends, and, and, and time off and rest and, and all of that. If, if you\'re just depleting people and you don\'t put that back, ultimately you\'re hurting the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Culture like for us, um, WordPress tech industry, you know, it\'s, it\'s, [00:14:00] it\'s damaging how the larger culture works and, and, you know, your, your employees move on to someone else than they mm-hmm , you know, they\'re are we, we should want to pass people out better than they were when they came in. Yeah. Or at least as, as good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, so it\'s not, uh, you\'re not damaging people. You\'re not damaging our ecosystem. Um, I, I feel like a human, I don\'t like the term. I kind of reject the term human resource, but mm-hmm , if you\'re gonna look at things kind of ecologically, you shouldn\'t draw down on that human resource. That\'s a commons too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our labor commons in, in WordPress. So yeah, hopefully this conversation that, that will, will continue and. Yeah, your, your article, I think was the first I\'ve seen someone kind of bring that out and yeah. I want to have to put you impeach it together. [00:15:00] Oh, okay. Have you met her?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have not. No. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It\'s, it\'s an important, important issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so I think two, we were, we were talking earlier about, um, mm-hmm, the, the history that\'s kind of at our backs too. Mm-hmm and. what people have been through and what in living memory, in their, in their family touches them, you know, it\'s different and we\'re not always sensitive to that, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the United States, you know, Canada\'s got another version of this here. There\'s if you\'re people don\'t exist in a vacuum and they don\'t come to you, um, in a vacuum and. When you, when you faced employers like that, where there\'s a clear, you know, we\'re gonna arbitrarily use, give managers power over you, does that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does that, [00:16:00] how does that register to you in the context of your family history? That someone like me probably doesn\'t have,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> well, it\'s always a red flag, especially with power plays and. You know, I\'m gonna tie it back to American slavery. Everyone\'s favorite topic . And so, uh, we talked a little bit about, um, living memory and how it\'s not that far back for that many people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have a very large family, a very old family and the things they experienced that they it\'s still, first of all, it\'s not that long ago and it\'s still. Just basically shapes what I do and how I feel about things today and specifically, um, you know, people like to talk about slavery. Um, well, so long ago, none of you guys knew any slaves and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s not true, especially from my family. Um, so I sent you an article about my great, great grandfather Jefferson do. And, uh, he was born in the 1950s. So he was born into [00:17:00] slavery in South Carolina and he lived a hundred. In 1850s, he lived 105 years. That\'s how old he was when he died. Wow. Um, so he lived until the 19, um, sixties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm um, as a matter of fact, the equal pay act, um, was, um, It passed in 1963, that was there. He died. So, um, my great-grandfather was alive for, uh, slavery. He lived through the civil war. He lived through the creation of the automobile. He lived through, you know, the early civil rights movements, um, Rosa parks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was alive to see Martin Luther king Jr. Walk, you know, and my mom was alive. My mom was, um, about eight. When he, he died, she still remembers running errands for him. My mom knew him. He was a slave. He was born into slavery. Um, his granddaughters, they were in their thirties. When he, when they died twenties or thirties, they\'re still alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three of them, um, in their late eighties. And, um, he was the patriarch of our family and the things he taught [00:18:00] them, the things he taught his sons, the things he taught his grandsons, his great grandsons that shaped our family that shaped our worldview. He would tell them, you know, these are things we did in slavery, but now that you all don\'t have to do that, this is what you should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told people that are still alive that today . Yeah. Um, so people don\'t realize how long ago, long ago. Wasn\'t yeah, we had laws in the book with just when he, he was not a, a free person when he was born. And by the time he died, there was a equal rights amendment for pay between men and women that was in the sixties that wasn\'t that long ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So . Legalized discrimination and pay is still happening. You know, they, that amendment doesn\'t go far enough. It doesn\'t protect against race, sexuality, religion, things like that. Um, just the things that happened to him. What happened to his daughters? What happened to his granddaughters? Those things follow me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His grand, his great granddaughter. [00:19:00] My mother integrated her high school. She was always paid less than everybody else. She went to H B, C U cuz. She could not go to other colleges. This was the seventies. Yeah. I\'m not talking about 2, 3, 400 years ago. Um, you know, so you know, my family always stressed education, getting the best education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They always stressed working somewhere where your employer respects you because it wasn\'t too long ago where they didn\'t have a. Yep. So I think it would take these companies. They would be well reminded to remember the people that they deal with, especially people of color in the United States. We\'ve been dealing with this stuff more recently than you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So do you want to be a company that\'s known as one that lived in the past that kept these bad things going? Or do you want to be known as a progressive company that was ahead of the curve? Yeah, they had the laws in Colorado, but your company in South Carolina, why don\'t you, why don\'t you jump ahead of the curve too?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why don\'t you do this? Why don\'t you do that? Yeah. Why don\'t you be the best you can be? Why don\'t you take this lemon me memory cuz it\'s all of our history, even though it happened to a certain subject we\'re Americans, it [00:20:00] happened to all of us. Yeah. All of us were a part of this. When this happened, our, our ancestors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Touched</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> all of the Americas touched everything and it Europeans doing it it\'s it was a global global system. And yeah, in a hundred years, you know, two, three generations in a family that\'s living memory and it\'s it\'s a hundred years. And that seems like a long time, but that\'s body memory. That\'s, you know, you\'re, was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is kind of more tended to in, in trauma, uh, psychology and understanding of that. And, you know, the, what is it? The genetically you are part of, um, an egg formed in your mother\'s mother mm-hmm and. This goes, it\'s a long, it\'s a long way back his, and you don\'t have to scratch the surface of any community to, to find the history [00:21:00] of, um, traumas there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mm-hmm , you know, I think I told you about, like, when I researched family history, one, one branch of my, um, uh, German Moravian ancestors who started out pacifists and abolitionists. And, and so on one branch went down and founded Winston Salem, North Carolina. And, um, they decided it would be okay if they had slaves, but treated them as spiritual equals, just not labor equals mm-hmm oldest black church in, in America is still running there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they\'re still in a kind of reconciliation process cuz there\'s um, it was, um, yeah, not a. Not a good thing, not a good outcome. And it\'s um, so yeah, my part of my family is on the other side of that. And you, I think if you, you dig down, it\'s not that far in Canada, we\'re dealing with. What everyone knew, but is now very publicly aware that [00:22:00] as late as the sixties, indigenous kids were being stripped from their families, put in the religious schools and, um, for cultural assimilation by force, and a lot of them were abused and died in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These mass graves that are coming up. And, um, what do we have to say about that is people are. Very touched in their families by, by that, that experience. Um, so yeah, I don\'t, I don\'t see how you can talk about, we want an inclusive culture without, and being historically ignorant of these mm-hmm of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. And people need to listen to people of color when they talk about this too. Like, I can trace my family back to here and we experience this stuff until now. Like, this is what you should do to make it more inclusive to help us. Oh, yeah, that\'s fine and dandy, but no, mm-hmm, no more butts. No, if ands or butts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.[00:23:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So moving, moving from one, one survey to another. So, you know, peach is doing the survey unemployment, um, Practices and, you know, it\'s a, it is a bit of a hot button, potential thing there mm-hmm um, and as far as I know, um, she\'s had all kinds of responses that have been cordial and professional and, and fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'s a, a white European woman. Um, and I\'m, I\'m glad I hope I\'m right about that. That that\'s, that\'s been. A question and a public kind of probing that we can handle maturely. But then yesterday we see Allie Nimmons, um, talking about a, what I would think is a much more benign survey, um, and getting a [00:24:00] lot, lot of shit mm-hmm and that\'s just not a not appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she\'s an African American woman. Um, Makes you think what, tell, tell me what your thoughts are, what, what, um, and what Allie was, was trying to do there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, so Allie was, you know, just trying to do a survey. Um, she\'s really, everybody knows. Allie is really big on WordPress contribution and, um, she\'s just trying to get a feel of how easy or hard it is for people to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can go about addressing ways to make it easier for. Simply it, you know, I think that\'s great. Um, you know, I see stuff every day about, we need more contributions to WordPress. Why anybody would be against people trying to help that I have no idea, but, um, the, a lot of comments she got were so passive aggressive, and that\'s not the first time I\'m seeing that in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, People are very, [00:25:00] very passive aggressive. When you ask questions. Um, no matter how benign they are, people, they have to flip it, especially if it\'s not like the questions they want to ask, which to me, I\'m just going to say they need to work on, but you know, that\'s all I wanna say about that, but I just think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people didn\'t consciously see, it\'s like, she\'s asking these questions. This is African American woman. The, all of the bad responses I saw were not from African Americans. And I don\'t think anywhere from women and they were just kind of jumping down her throat like, oh, you didn\'t ask this question the way I want you to ask it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I can\'t do this because this is not the way I would do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>what, first of all, what do you like? I, I wanna ask these people, like, do you talk to people like that at your job? Do you say, no, I can\'t help you with this project cuz you didn\'t do it the way I, [00:26:00] I wanted you to do it. Right. I, I, how many people like yourself do you talk to like that? But you know, I\'m not saying they were consciously malicious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will give them the benefit of the doubt, but that was something I just really didn\'t like to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And did you say, since you were working on, on this with her, this was, this was for, um, master WP, um, surveying. Um, yes, yes. Yeah. Did you say that there was, um, like you have some guys. Giving the kind of response of like, is this open to white people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this a closed survey? Like for, there\'s no reason to think that, right. Yeah. Other than that, she\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> running it black. Yeah. Why would you ask, why would you ask someone that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> they just assume, because she\'s running it, that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> it\'s a diverse survey. Yeah. There\'s no, it\'s only people of color. What, in your mind, how does your mind work to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, that, that was the response that annoyed me the [00:27:00] worst.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I have a hard time believing. They actually think that they are just have a chip on their shoulder because of their perception of what all kind of stands for in their mind. As I think reasonably outspoken person who is really good at taking on a lot of issues, we need to talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> The best, honestly,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> really okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> And, um, yeah, I just, I think it also comes from it\'s the community. That\'s another issue with us in diversity. We need a more diverse community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, she\'s doing it. Oh, basically for a long time anyway. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you\'re, there\'s other, there\'s a lot more, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, people had like interactions with people who don\'t look like them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would know when a person is asking a genuine question. That\'s why I\'m yelling from the clouds. We need a more diverse WordPress, because it\'s not enough to tell people this is how you\'re diverse or what we\'re just talking about. Like, you know, the history of us, and this is how we [00:28:00] interact, and this is how you can make it easier for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not enough to tell people that they need to experience this. They need empathy. They need to, they need to talk to people. Yeah. So pushing from more diversity and WordPress will definitely help with that. It definitely will. I I\'m sure we will see the difference. and I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I think kindness and basic respect, um, the negative outcome here is, you know, at least in the moment and the emotion of it now, like ally says, she\'s not gonna do one of these surveys again, and that\'s not what we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just having, doing something as simple as that, asking people on about a contribution to the project, um, That she gets kind of targeted in that way is just not a not okay. And to, to demo demoralize people, anyone out of doing productive, constructive work, like that is, is not something that is [00:29:00] healthy in any way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s still, you know, it\'s completely what we don\'t want. Mm-hmm um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>yeah, I hope I hope that comes out. In a better, better result than just we never ask these, these kind of things again. But, um, I, I re I, I recognize I was, you know, telling you about this before. I, I recognize where that comes from, and it, it\'s not just men, but there is, there is that white male fragility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I have, you know, I have that inside me too. There\'s like the, everyone\'s got a scared, frustrated child or, you know, there\'s that part of you, it\'s not your best self. And maybe in some people it gets the better of them a lot more. It it\'s in charge. Um, you got your own wounds, you got your own sense of grievances and why [00:30:00] wasn\'t, uh, why am I not, blah, blah, blah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you can see is someone else is getting preference ahead of me or something like that. I mm-hmm, totally admit to having a part that feels that has felt that. So I don\'t, I don\'t know. The big question for me is, and that came up in Michelle\'s misogyny article an issue. I don\'t know quite what to say to men who, um, I recognize where that comes from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. and it\'s really hard to know how to say this is something you gotta grow on in a con in a constructive way. Cause I think it\'s a genuine failure. It\'s mm-hmm , it\'s a, there\'s not a better, uh, better word for it. It\'s a, it is a genuine and common thing to have from being. Growing up in a, in a culture that doesn\'t have this kind of history at its back that we [00:31:00] were talking about that takes for granted things that are privilege, but we don\'t see it that way until we learn to see it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm until you, you move into it a different environment or something changes for you for, for me, it was, you know, after I was 12 or so, that was probably the last time I lived in a highly. Homogenous kind of environment and was mm-hmm generally in a minority myself. So, um, if you don\'t get stuff like that, I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, it\'s not an easy thing to grow on. And then you got grown men who, you know, they\'re, they haven\'t grown on that. Do you have any, any thoughts on that? Like how is that a, how do we crack that in? And it it\'s, it\'s a tough one, cuz you can. It deserves to be aggressively treated, but that, but still with, in some kindness and [00:32:00] understanding because you don\'t get anywhere with people, um, when you\'re both feeling grievance and anger,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I think, and I don\'t know if this is like, I would have to think on it more, but my first thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this process, cause it\'s been a while it\'s called, I think they called it sugaring. I don\'t, if that\'s not it, please forgive me. But, um, it\'s a process of just going through an unlearning internal biases that you may have, because like I said, I don\'t think most of these people did it maliciously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and just for an example where I learned this term, um, I got to meet some of the feminists of South Carolina, some of the, uh, older ones who helped write like the sexual assault laws and things like that. The most badass women I\'ve ever met in my life. Oh my gosh. And um, my old neighbor actually was one of them too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Hey, Dr. Sally Boyd. Um, but, uh, they were just incredible women and they talked about, you know, just fighting for different things for [00:33:00] women in the seventies and sixties and eighties in South Carolina. Um, they help integrate the Sears downtown because they didn\'t, uh, have black, uh, they didn\'t want black clerks out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funny story from that, what they did was one of the women had like five children and. They went to Sears and she was like, they told \'em just to let her children go. And they ran everywhere because they would go to talk to a manager and the manager would just never wanna talk to them. But when they let those children, wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clerks were so busy. The manager had to come out and talk to them. So , you know, but before they got to actually actions like that, which was incredible by the way, cuz these were rich, upper class white. And, you know, they believe in the quality for all, they were fighting for African American women to have this right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before they got to that step, they had to unlearn biases that they had. Again, they were upper class, white, rich women from the south. They were in a whole nother, you know, ballpark, a whole nother ballgame. And, uh, one of them talked about how one of the women they met was a doctor, but before they met her, they just heard they were talking to [00:34:00] Dr.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and so let\'s say Dr. Brown, Dr. Brown was coming to meet with them and they thought it was going to be her husband. and the woman walked in and it\'s like, you know, these are, these are feminists. They, they have, you know, actions they\'ve done, but they still had this notion that when I hear doctor as a man yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, things like that. So they told us like, you know, even though you all may think you\'re feminist, you may think you\'re, uh, freedom fighters. You may think you\'re, uh, fighting for people underneath you or your own race or your own gender. We all have these biases that we have to unlearn. And we all have to go through this process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don\'t think white men in particular. Told a lot to, you know, we need to go through this process and this is how so I think sugaring and I hope that\'s the word again, um, is what they do. If that\'s not the world, I\'ll correct myself. Next time we talk, I\'m gonna look it up. But, um, we just have to get together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, they have to get together and, um, just unlearn stuff and it starts with education. It starts with talking with other people, um, check your privilege, I guess, is what the kids say these days. [00:35:00] yeah. So yeah, I think that would be the most helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, sugaring to me sounds, sounds, um, I\'m thinking of sweet tea and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying to sweeten a otherwise bitter thing, but, um, mm-hmm yeah. I hear, hear what you\'re saying. I, yeah, and it, it probably never, it never really ends. My, my experience with it is, is you just kind of find, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>we\'re probably all better off acknowledging that we\'ve got, you know, you got, you got a shadow, you got a dark spot and you know, everyone\'s heart has got, uh, you know, that, that side that go, when things go, you know, you, you don\'t want the person you don\'t want to be, or hopefully you don\'t, you don\'t want, you know, the, the worst self is, is there in everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And. um, doesn\'t wanna [00:36:00] listen to other, other people is more concerned with its own, own sense of, um, entitlement or injuries or, or, or even even needs. And, um, yeah, that\'s a tough, tough thing to, um, to get people to, to take seriously and, and handle well, unless it\'s in, in a kind of community relational context where you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friendship and peer collegiality and respect as such a part of the culture and a priority that it\'s hard. You, you, it gives you a baseline. I, I, I think that\'s where all, all forms of contribution should feed that, that, um, that we\'re, we kind of hold each other up because. Open sources based on trust, like any, any good [00:37:00] community, any good relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you got that, you can kind of hold each other up a bit and tolerate some of some degree of conflict that\'s necessary and, and disagreement and hurt feelings and, and all that. But I not, not really that good at it all the time, probably better than some other communities, but I don\'t know if that matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> No worries. I, I agree with you. It\'s just communication and holding your community. A responsible charity begins at home. My grandmother always said that. So we look out for our community. Our community will look out for other communities. It\'s kind of like paying it forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, um, I think it\'s important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m glad I, I kind of know, we know something of each other, like where we live our stories or mm-hmm, , you know, background and I feel like in. Context. That\'s important to kind of slowly tell those stories and know that stuff for each other grounds, grounds things makes it harder to do that [00:38:00] internet psychosis, where it\'s not real people that you\'re shooting at, you know, just venting on or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and it makes kindness more the common ground. Well, that\'s a lot covered a lot. Oh yeah. We . We always do. Yeah. Well, that\'s. Maybe maybe next time we\'ll do do some more, um, techy, newsy stuff, but, um, yeah. Got a really good, a good question from someone who is outside the community and kind of, you know, wants to, to get in senior developer, wasn\'t done a lot of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would you advise that I do to get in? We\'ve had a bunch of answers come and, um, yeah, it\'d be interested in your take on some stuff like that. I\'ll probably write about it soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, let\'s get into that next. all right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Cool. Sweet. Thank you. You\'re</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> so welcome. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'m glad you look like a hundred percent back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rested, healthy post COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I looked that bad last week. Dang Dan. No, I [00:39:00] haven\'t said that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> smiling. Yeah. All take care. All you too. Best everyone on your, on your team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, I\'ll let \'em know. .

This idea resonated with participants in the discussion and plans are now underway to use a stripped-back version of Twenty Twenty-Two as the base for the new theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic design director Channing Ritter <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/10/twenty-twenty-three-default-theme-project-kickoff/\">published</a> a preview of what the base theme might look like with sample variations applied, along with the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1139275543113752375\">Figma design mockups</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Three&#8217;s predecessor has a highly opinionated design. The upcoming default theme is more like a blank canvas with the spotlight on the style variations. Headings are not as prominent, typography has been replaced with system fonts, and there are no images included. The theme will use the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-8-introduces-fluid-typography-support-and-revamped-quote-block\">fluid typography</a> feature released in Gutenberg 13.8, and has spacing presets in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One important note is that we are limited in the number of fonts we can include with the theme and should aim to use 3–4 different typefaces across all variations (in addition to systems fonts),&#8221; Ritter said. The initial list includes the following fonts, but can evolve based on contributors&#8217; feedback:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>System sans serif font</li><li>IBM Plex Mono</li><li>DM Sans</li><li>Source Serif Pro</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most exciting aspect of this project is that WordPress&#8217; design contributors have invited the community to take a stab at submitting their own style variations for consideration. The variations that are selected will ship as part of the upcoming default theme. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas many default themes in the past have come from a single designer or from an existing theme, Twenty Twenty-Three (TT3) will offer a kaleidoscope of style variations from different community contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme in progress is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree\">available on GitHub</a> and anyone can try their hand at creating a style variation. There are three different ways to do it. The most straightforward for some will be to create an alternate theme.json file and edit the code directly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who prefer to design their own variation visually in the editor can make changes to the Global Styles panel and then save them as a new style variation using the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/\" target=\"_blank\">Create Block Theme plugin</a>. This opens up contribution to anyone with design skills, even if they do not feel comfortable editing the theme.json file. Alternatively, contributors can design static mockups in Figma or another program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More detailed instructions for submitting a style variation are available in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/10/twenty-twenty-three-default-theme-project-kickoff/\">post</a> and those interested to contribute can join the new  <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/core-themes-projects/\">#core-themes-projects</a> Slack channel to ask questions and connect with others who working on the same project. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues/34\">first variation submission</a> to the TT3 repository is from new contributor Colin Chadwick, who created an eggplant color scheme complemented by the DM Sans font. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community is full of talented designers and this call for style variations is an incredible opportunity to contribute without having to touch any code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Style variation submissions for this project will close on August 31. The final curated set will be announced on September 7. The new TT3 default theme will ship with WordPress 6.1, which is expected on October 25, 2022.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 02:09:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"Matt: Telegram Channel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=59104\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://ma.tt/2022/08/telegram-channel/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:509:\"<p>You can now subscribe to updates from this blog in <a href=\"https://t.me/+oMWZJFfyMok2ZmUz\">this Telegram channel</a>!

A new <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/10/proposal-stop-merging-experimental-apis-from-gutenberg-to-wordpress-core/\">proposal</a>, published by Automattic-sponsored contributor Adam Zielinski, calls for contributors to stabilize APIs before merging them into core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, approximately 280 experimental APIs have been merged from the Gutenberg plugin, which Zielinski audited in a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40316\">ticket</a> he opened for the issue in April. In balancing the drive to move fast with iterating on the editor(s) against WordPress&#8217; commitment to backwards compatibility, the number of experimental APIs has become untenable and the practice of merging them into core is now being actively reconsidered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially, the experimental APIs are flagged as such to discourage third-party use, since they are expected to change. In practice, people building for the block editor are using them anyway because they are in core and they want to extend the features these APIs enable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Plugin and theme authors are forced to rely on the <code>__experimental</code>  features that could get removed or changed in a backwards incompatible way at any time,&#8221; Zielinski said, echoing the frustration and concerns many developers have had with the project the past few years. &#8220;It is a serious maintenance burden. Every new Gutenberg/WordPress release means potentially breaking changes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core committer Peter Wilson commented on the ticket, saying he is in favor of limiting experimental APIs to bleeding edge product. Driving home the need for this change, he <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40316#issuecomment-1123037463\">cited</a> a host of negative impacts that these core experimental APIs have had on the ecosystem:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<ul><li>core committers unwilling to use certain library features to make core tasks easier because they don&#8217;t trust the reliability</li><li>developers no longer upgrading WP client sites. As a core committer who has strived to maintain backward compatibility for years this disappoints me. As a security team member it&#8217;s greatly concerning</li><li>developers deciding to include copies of packages in themes and plugins rather than rely on the <code>wp.*</code> globals. Again this concerns me from a security perspective but it also increases the JavaScript payload significantly more than maintaining backward compatibility</li><li>reports of backward compatibility breaks in minor versions: &#8220;you don&#8217;t expect a 5.9.1 release to break the responsiveness of a bunch of images in our sites outside the block editor&#8221;</li><li>developers considering never using core blocks because they&#8217;re too unstable: &#8220;I stopped using/extending core blocks because they were changing too much and I’ve been using ACF Blocks so that I at least I know I can make blocks that won’t break. Granted the UI isn’t as good as core blocks but I’ll take stability over blocks breaking any time.&#8221;</li></ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gutenberg plugin was meant to function as a feature plugin where breaks in backwards compatibility are expected while contributors polish features before merging them into core. Getting back to the roots of this approach, and making the editor less experimental, is at center of this proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Instability between versions is already beginning to alienate some of the block-editors biggest external advocates,&#8221; Wilson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining this level of instability could discourage people from building on WordPress, pushing them away to other more straightforward projects that are managed in a different way. It is possible that the need to rely on experimental APIs has discouraged developers from building more products, slowing block editor adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a plugin author that is currently using <em>many</em> <code>__experimental</code> APIs, I would love to see these stabilized,&#8221; WP Engine-sponsored contributors Nick Diego said. &#8220;Most provide crucial functionality but building a product that relies on an <code>__experimental</code> API is always a bit disconcerting. So long as the process is exceedingly transparent, is well publicized, and we provide plugin/theme authors with a guide on how to migrate to stable versions, then I like this initiative.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of discussion on the ticket, Zielinski distilled contributors&#8217; concerns into the plan of action proposed on the Make WordPress Core blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal indicates that most of the existing experimental APIs already merged into core would get a stable alias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It would preserve backwards compatibility and shouldn’t noticeably affect the bundle size,&#8221; Zielinski said. &#8220;Some will need a different treatment; let’s discuss that case-by-case.&#8221; He also recommended contributors consider whether an existing experimental API already in core needs to be removed. He doesn&#8217;t anticipate many instances of this but recommends these use established practices of contacting plugin authors, using soft deprecations, and publishing Core posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I also see two things at play here: the use and abuse of experimental APIs during the API design (generally to be used and tested in the Gutenberg plugin) and the lack of a diligent process for stabilizing them when they satisfy design criteria,&#8221; Gutenberg lead architect Matias Ventura <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40316#issuecomment-1120863981\">commented</a> on the original ticket. &#8220;The ones that are to be considered <em>de facto</em> public are those that have existed for many releases in a stable form despite their nomenclature.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the interest of preserving WordPress&#8217; ability to deliver on its backwards compatibility promises, the proposal recommends experimental APIs be restricted to the Gutenberg plugin and never merged into core. In the instances where a stable feature depends on an experimental API, Zielinski identified a simple answer:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Then it isn’t actually stable. Let’s stabilize the dependencies first.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is essentially a new way of moving forward that should increase stability and confidence in WordPress&#8217; APIs and updates, but it does have a few drawbacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users and contributors can expect that Gutenberg features may be slower merging into core, as they cannot rely on experimental APIs when they hit prime time distribution in major releases. Zielinski also noted that contributors may also have difficulty refactoring these APIs once they have shipped and go into use on millions of WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far the proposal has had overwhelmingly positive support, as many believe these APIs should never have arrived to core in the first place while still in the experimental stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m very much in favor of this approach,&#8221; WordPress developer Mark Root-Wiley said. &#8220;I build custom themes and have a few simple plugins. For both, I have found myself somewhat frequently forced to deal with experimental APIs and the difficulties of keeping up to date with them when features are put in core that can only be turned off, adjusted, or extended through an experimental API.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A return to this sort of stability in core would go a long way to regaining some developer goodwill,&#8221; WordPress contributor Dovid Levine commented on the proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deadline for commenting on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/10/proposal-stop-merging-experimental-apis-from-gutenberg-to-wordpress-core/\">proposal</a> is September 7, which would close out the discussion just shy of three weeks before <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/06/23/wordpress-6-1-planning-roundup/\">WordPress 6.1 Beta 1</a> is expected. This gives contributors some time to more deeply audit the experimental APIs ahead of the next major release, should they reach a consensus on restricting them to the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 03:23:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:160:\"Post Status: Back Compat &amp; Experimental APIs, Safely Handling SVG via “Insert URL”, WordPress 6.1 Bug Scrub Schedule, Database Performance Health Checks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=104146\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:156:\"https://poststatus.com/back-compat-experimental-apis-safely-handling-svg-via-insert-url-wordpress-6-1-bug-scrub-schedule-database-performance-health-checks/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15629:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-august-9-2022\">This Week at WordPress.org (August 9, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Is it safe to insert an SVG via URL?

And so without further delay, I bring you Paul Bearne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Paul Bearne. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:52] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Thank you. All right. It&#8217;s been a hectic WordCamp, and feet haven&#8217;t touched the ground, but yeah, it&#8217;s good to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What have you mainly been doing over the last couple, well, I say a couple of days, maybe you weren&#8217;t here for contrib day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> I was here for contrib day, because I&#8217;m a core contributor. I&#8217;ve been working on the performance plugin. I&#8217;m lucky to be sponsored by XWP to work on core projects. And we&#8217;ve been focusing on the performance enhancements. So in the last release, we got five queries out of a standard homepage load. You imagine what that&#8217;s done to a million sites. And the performance add-on, I&#8217;ve been working on the dominant color feature, which is coming in the next block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s gonna be interesting to see the reaction of that in the community as that comes out. Cause that&#8217;s a visual change. And the WebP stuff. So I&#8217;ve been working, busy doing that, as well as running my own premium plugin, business. And it&#8217;s really nice to be able to work part-time for one of the big agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ll come onto that in a minute. You&#8217;ve got a talk here though, which kind of anchors us to what we&#8217;re gonna talk about. How did it go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:55] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> I think it was well received. A lot of people said it was really good value for them. Yeah, I think it went down really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just broadly outline what the topic was that you covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> It&#8217;s a lifestyle talk. basically trying to expand and give people confidence that they can create a lifestyle, whatever lifestyle they want with WordPress. You know, whether they want to be a digital nomad whether they want to live in the countryside or live in the center of a city. There is employment available in all of those places. And you need to look at yourself, see what your strengths and weaknesses are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a city or a country person? Are you self-directed or do you need to be managed? What&#8217;s your timekeeping like? Can you do sales? Can you do administration of doing invoices and tax returns and things like that? Cause if you can&#8217;t, you can&#8217;t be freelance, or not, not easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m lucky that my wife is good at the sort of administration stuff. So I&#8217;ve been able to do more freelance work than really I should be able to. But now my life&#8217;s changed a little bit and having been able to work full time or be paid by XWP to work on core, which is like a dream job for me. It reduces the amount of administration my wife has to do, and I haven&#8217;t gotta go chasing freelance work. It&#8217;s coming to me. The work is being found for me, and it&#8217;s interesting work. You can create whatever life you want. There&#8217;s a niche in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Presumably, if that&#8217;s the case that you&#8217;ve been through a whole cycle of different types of work, maybe you work for an agency and a&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:37] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> I went through the various types of agencies. We looked at multinationals, we looked at small agencies, big agencies, government digital services, media companies, high end design agencies in the center of cities, and then the distributed agencies, and touched a little bit on what it&#8217;s like to have a plugin, a premium plugin. What it&#8217;s like to be as a freelance person, because I&#8217;ve done all of those in my career. So I was able to give some, hopefully some insight to what it&#8217;s like to do those. And what&#8217;s the pitfalls and the bonuses of working in those different environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second half the talk I tried to give some career advice and some, you know, you can do this. This is gotta get noticed. How do you stand out in the crowd? How do you price yourself as a freelance person, and a few things like that. Try to set some reasonable expectations of what the market, what you need to charge to actually be viable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you look back on your life was it a series of trying things out and then ultimately dissatisfaction with the way that you were working and then try something new? Eventually find that that was not satisfactory and try something else and ultimately where you are now. And it sounds like at this point in time, you&#8217;re really happy with where you&#8217;re at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:51] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Yes, of course you have to take what comes. I talked in my talk about, details are okay. The trick is to fail fast and learn. So if you get into a situation where it isn&#8217;t right, don&#8217;t hang around. There is lots and lots of good freelance or good WordPress work out there, or just development work. You don&#8217;t have to put up with bad environments, horrible bosses, stupid hours. Not unless you are getting a reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re, if you are in a high end design agency, it&#8217;s a young game, and the burnout is quite high but they&#8217;re gonna pay you a little bit more. You&#8217;re gonna be working on really leading edge work. So you&#8217;ll put up with the hours. And you&#8217;ll be happy to go out and socialize with the team after work, because that&#8217;s part of the culture. But if that&#8217;s not what you want then there is other choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe that&#8217;s a young person&#8217;s game and then you mature into a slower agency, a local agency, or a distributed agency, or you go freelance. You get a few clients and you run freelance. Or maybe you do partly your own freelance or partly on the freelance platforms like Codeable, and you work that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I know that you said that failing fast is a desirable way to go about it. And I can see what you&#8217;re saying there in, in the sense that you&#8217;ve got a quickly figure out that this isn&#8217;t working, because then you need to quickly find something which is working. Presumably there&#8217;s gonna be a raft of people, anybody listening to this, there might be a load of people saying, yeah, that&#8217;s okay Paul, but I&#8217;ve already got the mortgage, and I am living hand to mouth, month to month. And I guess that plays in a little bit. You&#8217;ve gotta be a bit conservative in some regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Yes of course. Okay, so there&#8217;s a number of scenarios that are out there. So say you are working for a small agency serving the local community, which I think is the hard end of the business. Because you have to be a Jack of all trades. you have to do whatever work the agency finds, yeah. There&#8217;s no real picking, you know, they ain&#8217;t fussy about what jobs they take on, and they&#8217;re gonna be small and bitty, and not spectacular. But you want to break out from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;ve got things like, you could go freelance or semi freelance with the platforms. Codeable platforms, finding new work. But if you go freelance, you&#8217;ve gotta have enough money to pay for a laptop and have a space to work. You can&#8217;t do long term freelance from a coffee shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is a little bit of a, you know, can you actually even afford to do freelance, to start up? Because a modern Mac isn&#8217;t cheap, or even a modern good laptop isn&#8217;t cheap, PC laptop. So that&#8217;s the dilemma and I understand that dilemma, But there are choices. The amount of stuff that&#8217;s remote, you know, look at a remote agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are competent as a WordPress developer, you can be hired by a remote agency in no time. They are looking for people who are prepared to work, and they&#8217;re more interested in the attitude than your skill set. If you are, can get work done, they&#8217;ll hire you. And if you need to train up for a particular type of section of skill, to learn a bit more performance, you need to learn a bit more Gutenberg or whatever the flavor is. Yhey&#8217;ll train you. The good ones will. So you don&#8217;t need to stay where you are. There are options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting that you say that, you mentioned competence. I was kind of assuming that the competence would come before the attitude, but you&#8217;re saying it&#8217;s the other way around. Looking for people with a certain approach to work, who they can then up skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:33] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> I&#8217;ve hired people. I&#8217;ve hired students for year placements. I&#8217;ve hired people to work as colleagues. And when I do interview questions, I will start going down a technical tree somewhere. Cause I&#8217;m a geek. And I&#8217;ll keep going down a rabbit hole until they don&#8217;t know the answer. And then I explain the answer to them and I want to see a light bulb go off in their head. Oh, yes that makes sense. I understand what that was. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause I can train that person. I can teach them. They will learn. Cause as a web developer, I will never, ever finish learning. Every time I open up a piece of code I will learn something. One of the things I do in Core is I write unit tests and so I&#8217;m looking at functions that I&#8217;ve never seen before. I learn what the Core of WordPress does, function by function. And there&#8217;s stuff in there that I, say, whoa, that&#8217;s interesting. Oh, that&#8217;s clever how they did that. So you never stop learning. And if you stop learning, especially if you stop learning in some environment, time to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There must be drawbacks and there must be benefits to this whole approach. Let&#8217;s go with the good first. And that may be the time of day that you can work, the amount of money that you can earn, the location that you can put yourself in and so on. Over the course of the years that you&#8217;ve been changing things up, what have been some of the things that you&#8217;ve looked back and thought, uh, that aspect of that job was really good. And that aspect of that job was really good. Basically. What are the benefits of becoming a freelancer, I guess?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:05] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> You get to be your own boss and get to pick the clients and the work. You should pick the clients and the work. Don&#8217;t take everything that comes at you, because you need to pick work that you are an expertise in. Because if you are doing stuff where you are an expert, you can charge more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside is you gotta find it. It tends to be feast and famine in freelance. You&#8217;ve got too much work and then there&#8217;s no work. So you&#8217;re stressed because you can&#8217;t get the work done. And then you&#8217;re stressed because you&#8217;re looking for work, because you have nothing. So that is one of the major dilemmas of freelance. But you should earn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my talk, I talked about, if you expect your hourly salary to be say $60 an hour, talking universal currency of dollars, the freelance rate minimum is 120, 150 will be nice. That&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re aiming for. Because if you don&#8217;t charge enough, two things will happen. You will not be valued by your client, because, they&#8217;re cheap, they can&#8217;t be any good. And you&#8217;ll get crap work. I have a line in my slides, superstar prices get superstar contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get better work if you charge more. It&#8217;s not a case of more work, better work. Better work pays better. You can have a better lifestyle because you&#8217;re not working 14 hours a day. You&#8217;re working five hours a day to get that contract done. And you&#8217;ve got three hours to do your administration and look for your next contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the flexibility&#8217;s there. You mentioned the downside of the fact that you&#8217;ve gotta create that work or somehow have it created for you. Any other downsides that you&#8217;ve figured out over the years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:55] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Freelancing can be lonely because you are one per, one person shop, effectively. You need to work at that not being a problem. So if you are in a, a reasonable metropolitan area, look for meetups, peer groups. Come to conferences. Remember, you gotta pay for them and you gotta manage the time off for that. Your clients aren&#8217;t paying you while you&#8217;re away. Your company doesn&#8217;t earn. So you gotta budget for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. There may be other additional things, you know, like pension and healthcare and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:24] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> You won&#8217;t have any healthcare cover. You may be able to insure yourself, but you&#8217;re taking the risk on yourself. Pensions, if you&#8217;re charging properly, you can push money into your pension, because you&#8217;ve got spare cash coming in. You&#8217;re cash rich because you&#8217;re charging properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you need to be more self-disciplined? In other words, if you&#8217;re turning up to an agency at nine in the morning and you&#8217;re leaving at five and the work is handed out on plate and you&#8217;ve got briefings in the morning and then the briefings and blah, blah, blah. With this, you&#8217;ve gotta be a Jack of all trades a bit, but you&#8217;ve gotta be mindful that, you know, you, aren&#8217;t just sitting down having a coffee in front of the television, letting the work drift and drift and drift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:02] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Yeah, I have a friend in Canada he&#8217;s freelance business shall we say suffered? He let clients down badly. I picked a couple of clients up. He saw that I was linked to him on LinkedIn. They were chasing him and he was just got quiet on them. Awkward situation. I was able to pick some clients up because he wasn&#8217;t delivering. So you do need to have self discipline to be a freelancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not, then look at the other choices. If you want to be remote, look at what are the remote agencies, and they&#8217;ll do it. If you want to be in an office, are you compared to travel into the city center? Then look for one of the big design houses in city center. If you are up for the pace. If not, maybe there&#8217;s a local agency who&#8217;s servicing the local community, that feels right for you. Because they tend to be nice and friendly and family like, yeah, they&#8217;re cozy. But the work won&#8217;t be stellarly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess you&#8217;ve gotta be a bit, not just disciplined, you&#8217;ve gotta be self-motivated as well. You&#8217;ve got to be the kind of person that can incentivize themselves, because if you&#8217;re working for the man, as it were&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:10] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Who will drive the direction and push you forward. Being self-aware of where your strengths are, is the most important thing you can acquire. If you can get that self-awareness and be honest to yourself about where you are, what sort of personality you are. You may need to work for somebody, in order to actually get anything done, and that&#8217;s not wrong. In fact, being honest about that is a really powerful thing, and it makes your life less stressful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I worked for corporate in multinationals, it was a doddle. Nine to five, ate in the canteen, endless coffee supply, projects took forever. Downside is our server was IIS, yeah. But when I had to go to the US I had to fly business class, you know. There are pros and cons to all environments,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The WordPress ecosystem, obviously you are into the code, but you only have to look at the speeches that are on this weekend, and the presentations that are on to realize that code is a tiny fraction of the WordPress ecosystem. We&#8217;ve got SEO experts, and we&#8217;ve got copywriters and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you ever stray into a different territory or have you always been code all the time and therefore sort of increasing your portfolio and your CV, if you like, one job after the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:35] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> I actually for a while ran social media for corporation. I got there because I realized that we needed to own the brand names and I stepped ahead above the parapet and said, oy, Mr. CTO, we need to own these. Shall I go and get them? Had a fun story around corporate name changing, but, I went out and registered all the, the corporate brands. And for four years, before marketed caught up with me, I was the owner and access gatekeeper to all of their social media accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have wandered around a little bit but I am primarily a coder. That&#8217;s where my strength is. I understand by strength. That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t stay in social media. I&#8217;m not a writer, I&#8217;m not a content person. And so that&#8217;s part of me understanding my strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I kind of wonder if people who may be listening to this who figure, actually, I just wanna throw all the cards up in the air and see where they land. In other words, I just wanna try something new and everything that you&#8217;ve described so far fits that picture really nicely, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:43] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> All of this would work in, well, pretty much any industry I&#8217;m imagining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:46] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Yep, and detours are okay. Throw your ears up. You hear a sniff of something. Go knock on the door. Have a look in. Go and talk to people there. Go on interviews. I love interviews. I&#8217;d almost do it as a hobby, go on interviews. Go and see what they&#8217;re doing. And if it feels right, go and join them. If you don&#8217;t ask the question, it&#8217;s impossible for someone to say yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They might have to say no, but people actually like saying yes. So go look. Take a Friday afternoon off and go for an interview somewhere. If you just chalk it up as interview practice, you are not that serious. You get to look behind the curtain a little bit. You get some reference points about what an alternative life would look like. Think about moving to the countryside. Think about moving to the city moving to another country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can go and visit them. I emigrated from the UK to Canada in my fifties. I visited Canada a couple of times, found I liked it and then went through the immigration process. Uh, it took a couple of years to do that, but you get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned earlier about, well you said the words feast and famine or something To that regard, and I&#8217;m just wondering, okay, so I&#8217;m not talking about the money where the money may go up and the money may I go down? I&#8217;m talking more about the pipeline of work. Have you ever struggled with that? Have you ever had periods where, there really is nothing on the horizon. What have I done?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:24] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Oh totally and my solution in fact is to use Codeable. When I was freelancing, I was a member of Codeable from almost day one, very early joined there, and I&#8217;ve never done it as my full time gig. Now there are people who all the work comes through Codeable, but I&#8217;ve used it as my back fill. Whenever I&#8217;m a little bit short of work, I will go on a Codeable. I will bid for one of the contracts. Find a contract, get a contract and then do that project, because they&#8217;ve got so much work there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could go and pick a contract up really easily. And you could find one that fits your skill set and your knowledge base. Yeah, so I&#8217;m an expert in sort of job boards and things like that. So I would always go and look for something in that space, because I can provide skills and knowledge in that space, and it becomes easy for me to complete the task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are kind of running those two things, not quite in parallel, but they happen concurrently. But you&#8217;ve got your work, which is the desired outcome, the stuff that you&#8217;ve put in place for yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:25] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> I will get more income from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And then the Codeable is when the gaps appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:29] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Yeah. When the gaps backfill. If I&#8217;m short off work, I&#8217;ve got nothing to do for the end of the week I&#8217;ve got four hours. I can find a job on Codeable. Or I&#8217;ve got two days of spare capacity. Because everybody wants it done now on Codeable, brilliant. Rock up, log in. Go and see what the current list of open jobs are. Find a job that&#8217;s in your space that you can present value to. Don&#8217;t just go and do anything. And then go and fix that problem for that client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve had repeating clients who&#8217;ve kept, effectively become part of my freelance stable, still through Codeable, I&#8217;ve done ongoing contracts with them. So it works really well. And the Codeable guys are really, really nice. You know they have a lovely active Slack channel. They do regular meets and training. They almost feel like a distributed agency. That hybrid space. And that everybody there is competent WordPress designer, editor content, it&#8217;s not just code at Codeable. Remember that, so there&#8217;s other skills that could, people will hire you for there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Would you therefore suggest that&#8217;s possibly a good place for somebody to just begin? If they&#8217;re tentative and they&#8217;re you know, they could slot a bit of that into their weekend with their regular job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:48] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> They&#8217;ve got a regular nine to five job and they want to start learning, doing some freelance, it&#8217;s a really good place for them to get their feet wet, a little bit. In a very safe environment. Cause the money&#8217;s being collected by Codeable. It&#8217;s in the escrow. So you know you&#8217;re gonna get paid. If there&#8217;s a problem with the client the staff will wade in, and they&#8217;ll help you out. And if you get really, really stuck you can reach out to staff and they&#8217;ll find one of the other experts to come and help you. And if you get a problem, you could ping the Slack channel, say, how do I do this? And one of the other experts will wade in and help you. Very friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is it difficult to differentiate yourself, to make yourself stand out? It&#8217;s just you pitching for work. Presumably on Codeable you&#8217;ve got a set number of fields that you&#8217;ve gotta fill out to demonstrate how good you are at a certain thing. And, and everybody else has got those same set of fields and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:43] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Yeah, yeah it is slightly difficult. They are quite good about saying no more than five experts should reply to a client&#8217;s inquiry. So you don&#8217;t get millions of people trying to bid for piece of work. And they don&#8217;t do the lowest price wins. They average out the price bids. Someone puts a, a thousand dollars in for a project and someone else puts in 800, the client&#8217;s gonna get told 900. They take a commission off the top, or they add a commission on top of that price and they charge the client to that. And then you get your money out in USD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> One of the things that always attracted me, but I never managed to kind of make the leap, was this idea of being a digital nomad. So everything that you&#8217;ve just talked about, all of these rungs on the ladder of how to get work and how to manage your relationship with clients and build up your portfolio and all of that, all of that&#8217;s happened. And then you just don&#8217;t live in the same place for any great length of time. You flit about. You&#8217;ve sort of done that, you&#8217;ve moved a country. Do you know any people who do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:45] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> I have a good handful of friends who do that. Within XWP, I think have probably 20 or 30 people who are digital nomads within the company. I don&#8217;t think Codeable people tend to do that as much, because the infrastructure stuff that you need to do in addition to charging and billing and things like that, becomes difficult as you flip around the countryside and do stuff. Freelance people tend to hire local freelancers a little bit, so it tends to lock you into a country. And if you suddenly move, there&#8217;s some dynamics there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My recommendation, if you wanna do proper nomad work, go and talk to one of the distributed agencies, you know, Human Made, 10up, XWP, you know, that level of company. Especially if you are skilled as a WordPress developer. All of those are actively looking for people. I will personally recommend XWP. I do work there, but I&#8217;ve also worked at a few of the others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve got it right. They&#8217;ve learned over the years how to do remote web development and manage the culture and the team so well. And it&#8217;s art, and I think they&#8217;ve nailed it because they&#8217;re based in Australia, you know, the corporate HQ is over there. So all of the European staff they&#8217;ve got here, they&#8217;ve got 60 people at this WordCamp or something. They&#8217;re all of remote. There&#8217;s only about two or three have flown all the way over for Australia. And so, because they&#8217;ve done it, it just, they just nailed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Final question, did you ever, do you ever, sort of pinch yourself and reflect on how incredibly lucky you are? I say you, you, as in, all the people who have careers in the same manner that you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:38] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> Hey, I&#8217;m a guy who started as a tea boy on a building site, my first job. I now have a house on a lake with a motor boat tied up at the bottom. I would never have dreamt of that when I was a young lad. You really now in this day and age can work from anywhere. And as you know, Starlink and things like that are coming online, you really can go out into the sticks and work from anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anywhere you can get decent internet is now fair game as a location to do web development work and design work and other services. I&#8217;m a developer, so I tend to think developer first, but there&#8217;s PMs, there&#8217;s sales, there&#8217;s HR, there&#8217;s marketing, there&#8217;s video production, there&#8217;s design, there&#8217;s content writing. All of those can be done remote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you are physically manufacturing something, and even some of that can be done remote in small batches now. Anything in this sort of digital space can be remote and often better done that way. Unless you really doing high cycle stuff, I think remote is the way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Paul Bearne, thank you for chatting to me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:58] <strong>Paul Bearne:</strong> My pleasure.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"WPTavern: ServerPress Is Shutting Down\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=136826\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://wptavern.com/serverpress-is-shutting-down\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4381:\"<p><a href=\"https://serverpress.com/\">ServerPress</a>, makers of DesktopServer, a WordPress local development tool, announced it is shutting down after 12 years in business. The company <a href=\"https://us7.campaign-archive.com/?e=67f8ccf1b1&u=219119f2736c2f38b536dc982&id=f379709090\">emailed</a> its customers and posted a farewell message on its website after disabling new purchases and is in the process of canceling renewals for existing subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ServerPress was founded by Steve Carnam in 2010. His leadership helped the company remain independent of large hosting companies that have scooped up WordPress development tools of all kinds. Carnam described how the market has changed, forcing ServerPress&#8217; partners to make the difficult decision to close:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Earlier this year, one of the team members questioned whether or not DesktopServer v5.0 would have a viable market share. We had been so focused on building it out that throughout the development, we lost sight of constantly checking the temperature in the room.  Once we started discussing this we came to the conclusion that DS5’s potential market share has changed significantly over the last 10 years. The WordPress development tool landscape has grown and diversified greatly. This has diluted DesktopServer’s overall market share. The time, effort, and costs to bring in new users to DesktopServer’s workflow would be too much overhead for ServerPress to be sustainable. While many larger, well-funded companies would be able to absorb such costs involved, a company of our position cannot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>ServerPress did not communicate any plans for the future of its software products beyond the fact that they will no longer be supported. Longtime users and fans were disappointed to learn that the company is shutting down and some asked if they might consider making DesktopServer available to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am so gutted about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DesktopServer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DesktopServer</a> shutting down.

Then I used <a href=\"https://serverpress.com/\"><strong>DesktopServ</strong>er</a>. I liked it and soon bought a subscription for updates and support. It was host-agnostic and could be set up to push/pull to/from local and development sites. In practice, this could be pretty difficult to get working, but if you wanted to design sites in the browser locally, this was a good way to do it. <strong>MAMP</strong> <a href=\"https://www.mamp.info/\">remains a good choice</a> for local development, but DesktopServer was probably seen as the best tool for WordPress until about 2019 when <strong>Local</strong> emerged. This past week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShawnHooper/status/1554900277987360768\">DesktopServer closed its doors</a>, noting how <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/desktopserver-shutting-down-after-12-years/\">its independence from hosting platforms</a> had become a significant disadvantage:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“We’re a small company that has remained independent of large hosting providers and their influential budgets; this choice had initial market share benefits but longer-term financial constraints.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ServerPress</strong> (the parent company for DesktopServer) was <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/desktopserver-shutting-down-after-12-years/\">typical of the classic small WordPress company</a> and the small-scale success story associated with many WordPress businesses: well-liked and personable people involved in the WordPress community and its culture of giving back. Today, that story might be seen as ending in the era of product consolidation under big hosting platforms that are aiming at vertical integration in e-commerce, subscriptions, edutech — and the tools to build WordPress sites professionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-local-an-outstanding-but-less-open-product-without-strong-alternatives-in-a-consolidating-market\">Local: an outstanding but less open product without strong alternatives in a consolidating market</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ServerPress team also mentioned the diversification of the WordPress development tool landscape has become too complex to cope with as a small company, but for the type of tool DesktopServer is, there is really only one solution now. It\'s a safe bet that whatever market share DesktopServer once had only three years ago went to <strong>Local</strong> — then named &#8220;<strong><a href=\"https://localwp.com/\">Local</a> by Flywheel</strong>&#8221; after that hosting company\'s <a href=\"https://siliconprairienews.com/2016/12/flywheel-acquires-pressmatic/\">2016 acquihire</a> of <strong>Clay Griffiths</strong> and <strong>Pressmatic</strong>. Pressmatic <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/notes/pressmatic-wants-new-standard-local-wordpress-development/\">was first released that same year</a> and cost its users $99 with no freemium pricing. Rebranded and rapidly developed for <strong>Mac</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, or <strong>Windows</strong>, Local was <a href=\"https://community.localwp.com/t/open-source-the-project-local-by-flywheel/216\">not open source</a> but completely free — for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>Connectability</strong> — Anyone should be able to connect to anyone else who wants their connection. This is the foundation for community and well exemplified in tools that are easy to take for granted, like email and Open Source projects like Matrix.&nbsp;</p><cite><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/open-web-manifesto/\">The Open Web Manifesto</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Free — for now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-engine-acquires-flywheel/\">WP Engine acquired Flywheel</a> in 2019, and Local came along with it. Local was already a raging success, and it probably has only grown in its user base since then — if there was much remaining market share left to capture. To no one\'s surprise, a separate, subscription-based &#8220;Pro&#8221; version soon rolled out with the most useful basic features unbundled from the free version and bundled into the Pro version. Due to the negative response from Local users — which must have been massive — the plug was quickly pulled on Local Pro. Today, some features in Local still require additional subscription fees, but most users won\'t be crippled without them.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>If your host is able to open your books, why not ask them to open source the tools you use to build sites potentially on their platform? </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The effort to monetize Local this way appears to have failed due to the <a href=\"https://community.localwp.com/t/connect-to-any-host-that-offers-ssh-or-maybe-even-just-ftp-with-a-php-script-for-the-db/25792\">developer community\'s reactions</a>. At that point, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-makes-local-pro-free-for-all-users\">Local had 300,000 developers using it</a>, according to <strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> — and they strongly resisted &#8220;Pro&#8221; in force. Their resistance focused heavily on the lack of host-agnostic support for syncing files and databases. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress Dev Community: Paying for key features that come with platform lock-in is not OK</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>More specifically, I would say people who loved using Local hated how the Pro edition was packaged and designed to pull you into one particular host. If you paid to get more features, you also got more lock-in. And that hosting platform was designed completely around the concept of getting customers\' clients inside and handling things like billing for freelancers and agencies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Billing clients remains part of a paid extra, Flywheel\'s <a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/growth-suite/\">Growth Suite</a>. Using it might make your host more involved in your business operations and financials than your accountant! That\'s not a service everyone will want to purchase, as you might imagine — or even use if it was free. Some people obviously find value and maybe convenience in it. Trust really matters in that kind of business partnership, which is not the usual relationship between small to mid-sized businesses and their web hosts. It could be a two-way street though if that trust involves some reciprocity. If your host is able to open your books, why not ask them to open source the tools you use to build sites potentially on their platform? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beautiful product at the price of freedom</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel it\'s time for a bump to this issue&#8230;. Connect is a closed aspect of Local and we don’t seem to have any sort of mechanism or ability to add to or modify it ourselves, meaning we can’t even write our own extensions to Connect for other hosts and feel this needs to be addressed in totality not just adding a new connection to appease just a handful of users.&#8221;</p><cite><a href=\"https://community.localwp.com/t/connect-to-siteground/25624/24\">User dsnid3r on the Local Community Forum</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Local has continued to advance. It remains widely used and is, as far as I know, unmatched in features with no direct competitors. There\'s integration with WP Engine\'s new tools for headless sites, like <strong>Atlas</strong>, along with <strong>Migrate</strong> and other tools acquired from <strong>Delicious Brains</strong>. Add <strong>Genesis</strong> — which represents WP Engine\'s &#8220;<a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/open-web-commitment-genesis/\">commitment to the open web</a>,&#8221; and consider where it\'s likely headed with <strong>Full-Site Editing</strong>. (See the work <strong>Mike McAlister</strong> has been doing on <a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-engine-acquisition/\">FSE Studio</a>.) You can imagine the end result being just about anything needed for WordPress site builds, from relatively simple content sites to complex applications and headless installs. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hey EJ!

It\'s certainly been on my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Local\'s Connect feature (what makes it fundamentally useful) was promoted as one that would be opened to other hosts.

Ijebu precisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:01:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onealtr/\">Oneal Rosero</a>. I am from the Philippines and I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe</strong> <strong>00:02:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamsirotee/\">Theophilus Adegbohungbe</a> . And I&#8217;m from Ilesa, Osun State in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:02:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ugyensupport/\">Ugyen Dorji</a> and I&#8217;m from Bhutan. And I&#8217;m working with WordPress for more than five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I enjoy the most about being part of any community is being able to see how people change and grow over time as they learn and gain confidence in their own expertise. So a favorite early question is naturally, ‘How has WordPress changed your World?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:02:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my world in many ways. But, uh, starting from the moment, it allowed me to become part of a global connected and welcome community. I started using WordPress as a blogger many, many years ago, but it was in 2015 that I started working behind the scenes of WordPress with a plugin company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the moment when everything changed, basically, because I realized that WordPress was much more than a CMS for creating websites. It was a world full of opportunities for networking, making new friends and walking a new professional path as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:03:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview, I was asked many questions about WordPress and although I had a basic understanding of WordPress, I struggled to give detailed answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that interview, I resolved to develop my skills and learn as much about WordPress as possible. A few months passed and I received a call from ServeMask In, [who] had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration plugin. They offered me a position which fulfilled my wish to work with WordPress full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, I am now an active contributor to the WordPress community as bread and butter, with the best career in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are very familiar with my country, Nigeria things here, it&#8217;s not as smooth as it is in other parts of the world. That is, when you are done in school in my university, you have to find means of surviving yourself.&nbsp; There is nothing like the government have work for you. There is nothing like you finish our institution and you get job instantly. So it&#8217;s very tough here. And, year by year, schools keep producing graduates with no companies to employ them and no government job again as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I personally, I was able to gain freedom from this with the help of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:04:51]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress completely changed my work life. I started working independently. I started freelancing with agencies and designers and, uh, building websites from their web designs. And this was around the time my son was born. Actually, he was in elementary school and I think this was around 2014 or so. I started working remotely when remote was not even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were very few companies that let you work from home and remote was not a mainstream thing at all, but with WordPress, I could set my own working hours while my son was in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:29]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, my preferred follow-up question of, ‘How did you hear about us?’ or ‘How did you connect to this global community?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:05:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, actually what I love about WordPress is that it&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s not a business. It&#8217;s not a company. It&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s always ready to help support, teach and encourage people. That&#8217;s how I felt when I joined the community. There&#8217;s always somebody who has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always somebody who&#8217;s going to guide you. There&#8217;s always an expert who will take your hand and lead you into the beauty that is WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:06:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that I connect with the global community these days are one, of course, is .org Slack. Another of course is Twitter as there&#8217;s a very active WordPress community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with WordCamps all over the globe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been able to travel to several hundred WordCamps through the years in the US and abroad. And that&#8217;s one of the most rewarding parts is meeting people from all over the world and you see really how small and the world really is and how similar we really all are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:06:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not until 2020. I don’t know if you know this lady, a very vibrant lady in WordPress. She&#8217;s from Nigeria; her name is Mary Job, and she&#8217;s really promoting WordPress here. So it was through her that I got to know about the community. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:06:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is the global WordPress community. So we hold our three programs for the global WordPress community, and we are always trying to reach more and more countries. For quite a while, it was very North America-heavy, and then I made some efforts to expand. And it&#8217;s very exciting that this year, some contributors in our team have actually launched an Asia Pacific branch of our group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have two meetings every other week where we have the America/Europe and the APAC, and we&#8217;ve also been able to reach other countries as well, but we typically reach something like between 20 and 50 countries a year, depending on the year. So a hundred percent global. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has WordPress, either the CMS or the project, made you feel more connected? And are there any surprising connections that came from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal&nbsp; 00:07:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the surprising connections I think that have come from WordPress have been the fact that I feel like I&#8217;ve got friends all over the world. And a lot of those have come out of community involvement and from contributing. That I could go to a, a meetup pretty much anywhere in the world and probably find somebody I know, or at least a second degree connection of somebody that I haven&#8217;t, you know, that I might not have met, but know somebody that I know. And certainly that happens fairly regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:08:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress. The WordPress project, the community, has made me feel connected in a huge way, because I am literally surrounded by everything WordPress. So I like how, when you meet somebody who does WordPress, there&#8217;s this instant, ‘Oh, we&#8217;re brothers,’ or&nbsp; ‘Oh, we&#8217;re sisters!’ You know? There&#8217;s that feeling? That&#8217;s how I feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see somebody who does WordPress, as I do, I&#8217;m like, ‘Oh yeah, we&#8217;re, kin.’ You know? We are family. That&#8217;s how I feel when I meet people who do WordPress. And I&#8217;ve met quite a number of people who do WordPress from like around the world. Like I have a friend here, he&#8217;s from the Benin Republic, and we host started a dinner on Friday night and one of my guests was asking me, ‘How did you guys meet?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ‘Oh yeah, we work in the same WordPress ecosystem.’ He attended our WordCamp, we became friends, and we just literally became really good friends. So I have tons of people that I&#8217;ve met like that I hold in high esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:09:12]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Meetups are the seeds that lead to the growth of WordPress communities. WordCamp is a platform for plugin and theme developers to meet WordPress users and website developers. It&#8217;s a great environment where many incredible discussions about WordPress takes place. With each WordCamp there is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; meeting, where I think people [can] get more connected. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity for aspiring computer engineers, generators and get to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the project level, it has given me the opportunity to feel like an active part of a global project. The idea that I can give my contribution to making the web a better place &#8211; it’s amazing. And I do so with the Translation team, so making WordPress accessible to all the people that use the core plugins and themes in Italian, and prefer to do that in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What area of the WordPress world is most important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:10:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a little bit of a passion for diversity in tech and diversity in WordPress, specifically around events. And so, here&#8217;s a chance to name the three programs that we&#8217;ve been working on this year. So as mentioned a few times, we have our <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/\">Diverse Speaker Workshop</a> that helps people go from not even having the thought that people could step up on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second program is because of the pandemic. There was no longer the straight path from taking our workshop to speaking, because we used to hold them or people used to hold them for their WordCamps and meetups. And so it was like, okay, you&#8217;ve taken. Apply for our next WordCamp or meetup. But during the pandemic, that wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have this amazing channel that we welcome everyone to join, allies and people from underrepresented groups who are interested in speaking or interested in supporting people and speaking. And that&#8217;s the Diverse Speaker channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H\">diverse-speaker-support</a> channel on the Make WordPress slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third program is, and we, we went through a name change recently. So I&#8217;ll try to remember the new change it&#8217;s Organizing Inclusive and Diverse WordPress Events. And this is for WordCamp and meetup organizers to learn. We&#8217;ve learned over the last couple years, how important it is to create inclusive spaces and be good allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we actually do that? And a few of us created a very action oriented workshop in 2019 for WCUS, and that is now the basis of the work that we are bringing to people and people are loving it.. We&#8217;ve had people report a 40%, self-report 40%, increase in feeling prepared to create an inclusive event from before and after taking that workshop, which is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, that’s my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:12:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love helping the WP Diversity team. I love running the workshops. I love running the workshops for myself, because I used to do training for software back before the pandemic. I used to train up to a thousand people a year in person, sometimes like 500 people in a room at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course I had to shift. I had to pivot to online training, which is what the training team has brought for me. And the focus on the diversity. I like running the workshops. I like running workshops for different groups, different countries, because it&#8217;s nice to meet new people. It&#8217;s nice to hear about their culture, about the limitations that people have in Africa with connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they resort to using WhatsApp on their phone in order to do a meetup. That&#8217;s how they do their, their meetings, their discussions. It&#8217;s unlike other countries where we can do video calls. They have to use their mobile phones because connectivity isn&#8217;t accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places like in the Philippines that get affected when it starts to rain a little bit, we lose our internet. So we have backups and our backups have backups. So there are many things that you learn that are different when you&#8217;re living in the city, when you&#8217;re living in the provinces, in the country. So it&#8217;s so many things that you learn about people and how they&#8217;re able to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:13:35]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling end users to reach their goals. And whether that means participating in contributing to the software, to the Core software itself, in terms of UI/UX usability. That can include participating in the community and sharing your knowledge proactively with users who may be new to the platform, or have used WordPress for a while, but now want to step up their game, get a little deeper into using their websites as a tool for growth, for whatever business that they&#8217;re in. So, I mean, overall, the, the most important part of the WordPress world to me are the end users. And, you know, there, there is this quote unquote inner circle of WordPress community people. People who are involved in .org, people who contribute to the software, people who contribute to the 20 plus make.wordpress.org teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those we have to keep in mind, are not the average user by and far. They are not the typical user that hears the word WordPress and then goes out and searches it and then has to figure out how to use it. So I think user experience is probably the most important part for me and making sure that any of that innate knowledge that we have in that inner circle of WordPress because many of us have been using it for so long, keeping in mind that is not the norm. And it&#8217;s not the scale at which WordPress is used and, and making sure we translate complex concepts down to a layperson&#8217;s terms that might not be as familiar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have always found so fascinating about the web and WordPress’ role in it is how it has made the world simultaneously smaller and bigger. By giving voices to the voiceless we help each other find our community niches regardless of where they are in the world. Some of your closest friends could be people you would never meet in your own neighborhood. Well, let’s hear what some of our community members had to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Tea 00:15:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the thing that has been most empowering is, is coming into the project either in terms of contributing time and efforts to the community, which is where most of my contribution has been &#8211; has always been about this is a really cool thing, and I really want to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll put my time and efforts into building WordPress. Not for me, but because I see its value and I see its community and I see that the contribution that it&#8217;s making to the world and I, and that&#8217;s really important. But finding that on the other side of that was a huge amount of personal benefit for me in my career, in the friendships that I&#8217;ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel like if I had been approaching the community with, I want a better career, I wanna meet all of these people and I want, and I want all of this. From, “I want” for me, instead of, I want for this project, for the community and effectively for the world with that, you know, that whole democratized, the democratizing of publishing is this thing that serves the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s been the key for me is that I absolutely have reaped amazing benefits from it, but it came out of that sense of, I see this value here and I want to contribute to that because it&#8217;s gonna have value, not just for me, but for a whole slew of people. And so, uh, you know, for much, much bigger impact than just on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that&#8217;s the important thing for me is that sense of, if you approach it with that attitude of what can I do to help? It&#8217;s amazing what you will find yourself helped with in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed this tour of WordPress in the World Wide Web. I want to share a big thank you to all of the folks who contributed to our little WordPress Briefing celebration of World Wide Web Day today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. So firstly, we&#8217;ve got a couple of updates from our upcoming flagship events. WordCamp US has announced a speaker support fund specifically for historically underrepresented speakers at the event. You can donate to the fund on the page if you&#8217;d like, and there are also directions on how to request support, if you are part of an underrepresented group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the folks over at WordCamp Asia, the call for speakers is live. That&#8217;s taking place in February, 2023. But it&#8217;s never too early to brush up those presentations and get them submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next big thing is that there are some changes coming to the WordPress mobile app. A lot of the Jetpack functionality will be removed from it, so this is going to have a little bit of an effect on daily users of the app, but it will also have an effect on regular contributors. I&#8217;ll have a link to the full write up in the show notes so that you don&#8217;t have to guess or hold it all in your memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this excellent design that you see on wordpress.org/news is finally making its way out to the next parts of the wordpress.org website. Before you know, it, there will be a fresh looking homepage as well as few other pages and then… to infinity and beyond (or something like that).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And next up I&#8217;ll be taking just a mid-year break from the podcast. And so the next time that I actually see you again, will be in September.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13198\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"People of WordPress: Carla Doria\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/people-of-wordpress-carla-doria/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 19:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13201\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:324:\"In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

It only needs an adventurous and playful spirit,” said Carla</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no profits, and any income mainly went to pay the store’s rent. At the time, her previous company contacted her for a job opening that matched her profile. Carla needed that income and decided to closed the store and forget about being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in employee mode, Carla started her new job as a technical writer for a software development company. Since Carla had completed her master’s degree in the UK, she was proficient in English. Her close affinity for computers and technology made it easy for her to translate complex software jargon into simple tutorial steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Carla got more interested in technical writing and started to improve her writing skills. This reconnected her with her previous enthusiasm for writing, and she decided to channel that interest into a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diving deep</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating her blog helped her become more familiar with WordPress and building websites. In 2015, Carla blogged about writing, her thoughts, book reviews, and everything that came to mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through looking for answers to specific issues using her WordPress blog, Carla found the support forums a useful place to go. Soon she realized that she could also help answer other people’s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13189\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla began checking the forums as a hobby. She liked that she was able to help people and learn more while doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of surfing social media during her work breaks, Carla focused on checking the WordPress forums. Through this she learnt about a support job in one of the global firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt the job was made for her and was excited to support people in building their websites with WordPress. The role offered the possibility to work remotely and travel while still working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years as a technical writer, her career felt stuck. She was certain she did not want to return to any job related to industrial engineering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla did not get through the selection process the first time. But after nearly 18 months between three applications and learning HTML and CSS, Carla finally secured a support job in 2016. With this job, WordPress became her main source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading a local WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job, Carla learned about the WordPress communities around the world and WordCamps. But when somebody asked about the WordPress community where Carla lived, she didn’t know what to say. Was there a community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She discovered no local group existed, so she researched what was needed to setup a meetup. Carla discussed the idea with others, but hesitated as she thought it would require an expert WordPress developer to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after trying to gauge interest, Carla realized that the only way to find community members was to start a community. In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cochabamba-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress community in Cochabamba</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"684\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=684%2C391&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The theme preview screen in the WordPress Cochabamba meeting on creating your website with blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-13236\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>WordPress meeting in Cochabamba explored creating your website with blocks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The group has had ups and downs, probably similar to any other community. Although Cochabamba is not a big city, they had issues finding a location that was free and available to anyone who wanted to join. People came with different levels of knowledge, from people with&nbsp;vast experience with WordPress to people with no experience but who wanted to learn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community grew during the pandemic, as meetups went online and people from other cities in Bolivia were able to attend. After restrictions were lifted, there was a lot of excitement amongst members to meet each other in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Giving back through speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Carla reading a book under a tree\" class=\"wp-image-13191\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The community also helped Carla to develop a new skill in public speaking. She applied to be a speaker at WordCamp Mexico <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2019/\">2019</a> and <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2020/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://guayaquil.wordcamp.org/2019/\">WordCamp Guayaquil 2019</a>, and <a href=\"https://colombia.wordcamp.org/2020/\">WordCamp Colombia in 2020</a>. Her confidence grew while she enjoyed connecting with other communities and meeting people who were on similar pathways. Not all of them were developers, as she had presumed. Many, like her, started out as bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"977\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=977%2C419&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Cochabamba\'s logo with blue and grey lettering and a hat\" class=\"wp-image-13228\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?w=977&amp;ssl=1 977w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=768%2C329&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after three years, Carla applied to organize her first WordCamp in 2021 in <a href=\"https://cochabamba.wordcamp.org/2021/\">Cochabamba</a>. She had never imagined organizing any WordCamp, and through this having the experience to talk to sponsors and contact companies, and lead a group of people with different talents and backgrounds. Carla felt she had learnt so much from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to WordPress, Carla found a job she enjoyed, was able to work remotely, and help build something in her community to help people learn skills and find career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla feels grateful for all she has been able to do thanks to WordPress. She said: “WordPress has led me to find good jobs. It also has allowed me to contribute to a community of friends that love learning about WordPress.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Alison Rothwell (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpfiddlybits/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>wpfiddlybits</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Surendra Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>sthakor</a>) for work on this feature, and to all the contributors who helped with the series recently.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe. And that should help you work your way through phase two and get ready for phase three if that is where the spirit takes you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13162\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"WordPress 6.0.1 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/wordpress-6-0-1-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 16:58:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"6.0.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"minor-releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13138\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:236:\"WordPress 6.0.1 is now available for download.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"The Month in WordPress – June 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 14:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13069\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:313:\"With WordPress 6.1 already in the works, a lot of updates happened during June.

The potential and power of blogs would be an influence in the rest of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo sat in front of a pond. \" class=\"wp-image-13027\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Leo&#8217;s confidence grew through expressing himself in writing, he was determined that his stutter would &#8216;no longer hold power over him&#8217;. In 2005, with the encouragement of his blog readers, he spent his school summer break in his room working on reducing his stutter. WordPress would be the tool that would enable him to connect with his blog readers and to express his creativity and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making WordPress your own</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Leo had opted for programming as one of his subjects. In 2008, he built his first website using WordPress for the students at the school. This was the first time he saw the real value of WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the following years, he increasingly spent time searching online for information on &#8216;Customising WordPress&#8217; and &#8216;Making WordPress your own&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo wanted to keep busy and as soon as he finished school, he applied for every entry-level web-related job that he could find. He was hired by a company for the role of webmaster for its Marketing team focused on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued to grow his skills as a WordPress developer with the help of useful documentation that he could find and through his helpful local WordPress Community. This helped him earn a living and support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping yourself through helping others in the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Leo moved full-time to Cape Town, South Africa, and started as a developer at a web development agency, eventually progressing to its Head of Development and managing a small team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He chose WordPress as his main platform for development mainly because of the community behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Had it not been for those searches on how to make WordPress your own, my life would have turned out a lot differently</em>.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo felt he had a hurdle to overcome working in web sector. He didn’t feel like a ‘real developer’ being self-taught. However, through the community, he realized that there were many self-taught developers and he was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside his development path, Leo faced a mental health journey. He had suffered from depression and found the community to be accepting and understanding of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, he stood in front of an audience and gave a talk: “<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>”. Following this talk, he was greeted by many attendees who thanked him for talking so openly about mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at the podium at WordCamp Cape Town in 2016\" class=\"wp-image-13023\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been diagnosed with bipolar, previously known as manic depression. In 2017, he hit a low period and struggled to keep going. He found support and understanding in the community in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has openly written about his experiences with depression and started an initiative where topics of mental health and general wellbeing can be freely and non-judgmentally discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that by helping others, he is helping himself, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has contributed to the community as a Co-organizer in South Africa for the 2016 and 2017 WordCamp Cape Town, WordPress Meetup Cape Town 2015 &#8211; 2016, and WordPress Durban 2017 – 2020. He has also spoken at a number of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining connections with people he had met through these events Leo felt was a great aid to his mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has contributed to core and plugins and believes that WordPress and its community make it extremely easy to contribute. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>The cost to start contributing is extremely low &#8211; start now</em>”.</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ability to create and add patterns to the WordPress.org library came out in 2021, Leo used it almost immediately and created a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/call-to-action-section-2/\">call-to-action box</a> which could be used by both his clients and the community. He plans to release a few more complex patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yes, we can.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo’s mantra is “I can do it!”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at a WordCamp Cape Town in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-13032\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?w=1944&amp;ssl=1 1944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting over a stutter, overcoming poverty, being urgently self-taught, growing up in a country with “load shedding” electricity outages, and one of the slowest rated internet speeds in the developing world, and strengthening mental wellness are not easy feats., And yet, he knows he can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Never, ever think you do not have the &#8216;right&#8217; circumstances for success.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right my friends. So it&#8217;s been about a month since WordPress 6.0 came out and you know what that means. It means we are already looking at the next major WordPress release because,&nbsp; as most of you know, WordPress never sleeps. Y&#8217;all are honestly up and hustling like 24/7 as far as I can tell, which is great! And is one of the many benefits of being a global community, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, back to this major release. There was a high-level roadmap shared by Mattias Ventura at the start of June. And it lists some focus areas for the Block Editor, continued refinements to the template editor and navigation block, and some work on global styles and more / better blocks and design tools that are slated to ship with WordPress 6.1. From the WordPress core side, though, there are a couple hundred tickets that are milestoned for the next major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being milestoned for a release means that either a ticket wasn&#8217;t ready for the last release and was moved to the next available one, or a ticket has become ready for a release since the last major release occurred. That list as it stands might be a little bit too big for a single release. However, honestly, no list is too big if we have enough folks contributing.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve never contributed to a major release of WordPress before, and you&#8217;re interested to know how that works, there are some things to keep an eye out for over the next few weeks. We are in what is considered the planning phase for the next big release. And so there are two or three things you&#8217;re gonna see pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First is a planning kickoff post. That post gets published on make.wordpress.org/core, and it includes notes on volunteering for the release squad, some guesses at areas of focus based on the tickets that we&#8217;re seeing in track, a schedule, the whole kit, and caboodle. It&#8217;s all in there. If you are wanting to know how to lend a hand and how to take your first steps to core contribution, apart from the new contributor meeting that happens before the dev chat, that post is the place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for that. And then the second thing that shows up in the planning phase for any major release is bug scrub and ticket triage meetings. Like I mentioned, there are the new contributor meetings where they scrub tickets and talk through the basics of what we&#8217;re seeing on good first bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mentioned that here often, I just mentioned it in the last, in the last bullet point, but there are also regular bug scrubs and ticket triaging sessions where a kind contributor chooses a set of tickets to review and then leads other contributors through the process of checking to see if a ticket is valid to see if it can be replicated to see if it has a patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are decisions that are blocking it and how to move those decisions forward, and generally just kind of discuss what else has to be done in order to take the ticket to the next step. Those get announced in the dev chat every Wednesday, but also there is a post that will go up on make.wordpress.org/core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had a faster way to say that instead of just racing through the whole URL every time. But it&#8217;ll be okay. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes in case you would rather just click some stuff. And the third thing to keep an eye out for. If development is not your thing, so writing code is not already part of your tool belt, that&#8217;s totally fine. There are many other important areas where you can contribute, too. Design, training, support, polyglots, marketing, documentation, and more. These teams all do work in and around a release that is vital to WordPress&#8217; overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:19]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final thought of all. If that felt a little too intense if you want to see where this ship is headed, but you can&#8217;t quite commit to grabbing an oar today, that&#8217;s fine, too. The most important thing is that if you are a member of the community, as an extender or a user or a die-hard contributor, or a new contributor, the most important thing is that you have some general awareness of what the overall direction is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might do that by experimenting with blocks in your products or by testing screen readers against your workflow or even by setting aside an hour to participate in the latest testing prompt. Being aware of what&#8217;s happening in and around your area of the project will help to keep you kind of prepared and knowledgeable to lend a hand whenever it is that you are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that then brings us to our small list of big things. My friends, registration is now open for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India. That&#8217;s taking place on September 24th and 25th. Uh, it&#8217;s happening over Zoom, so location or travel shouldn&#8217;t really be an obstacle for you. I&#8217;m going to leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. It should be an excellent opportunity that [the] WP Diversity initiative that WordPress has, that the community team helps to foster, is really an excellent experience. And so I hope that you register and attend that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing actually is a bit of a celebration. The Photo Directory recently hit a huge milestone of 3000 photos! And you also can submit your photos to wordpress.org/photos. If you feel so inclined to make a contribution of that type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:06:07]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things is actually kind of a, a WordPress tooltip a little bit of a WordPress project did-ya-know? So, there is a special channel in WordPress Slack for sharing thanks to folks who were especially helpful to you. It&#8217;s called the Props Channel. And when someone shares props with you, it even shows up in your activity on your wordpress.org profile. Pretty cool, huh? Props to the Meta team for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WP Briefing: Episode 33: Some Important Questions from WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/06/episode-33-some-important-questions-from-wceu/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 11:01:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy covers some important questions from WordCamp Europe on this special episode of the WordPress Briefing podcast. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:60:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/WP-Briefing-033.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13788:\"\n<p>In the thirty-third episode of the WordPress Briefing, hear Josepha Haden Chomphosy recap important questions from WordCamp Europe, and a selection of Contributor Day interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"WordPress 6.0 “Arturo”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 May 2022 20:01:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12879\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:278:\"Say hello to “Arturo” and WordPress 6.0, inspired by Grammy-winning jazz musician, Arturo O’Farrill.

With thoughtful updates to the writing experience, building better block functionality, and adding a new intuitive style switcher, I’m really proud of the work that’s been done in this release to make a great site editing experience.</p><cite>Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Executive Director</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0.zip\">Download WordPress 6.0</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s Inside</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple lines of text from two blocks\" class=\"wp-image-12887\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enhanced Writing Experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing improvements abound, whether you’re writing a brand new post or adding elements to an existing page. Explore more ways to streamline your content creation process, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select text across multiple blocks for easier copying and pasting.</li><li>Type two open brackets `<code>[[</code>` to quickly access a list of recent posts and pages.</li><li>Keep existing styles when you transform some blocks from one kind to another—from a Paragraph block to a Code block, for instance.</li><li>Create customized buttons and any new buttons you make will retain the style customizations automatically.</li><li>Make tag clouds and social icons even more appealing with updated settings and controls, and a new outline style for the tag cloud.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Style-switcher-big.gif?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Style variations of Twenty Twenty Two theme\" class=\"wp-image-12893\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style Switching&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes now include the option to contain multiple style variations. This expands the new Style system even further and enables shortcuts to switch the look and feel of your site all within a single theme. In block themes that support this feature, you can change both the available settings, like the font-weight, and the style options, like the default color palette. Change the look and feel of your site with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Popover listing available templates\" class=\"wp-image-12889\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Template Choices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 includes five new template options for block themes: author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy. These additional templates provide greater flexibility for content creators. Tailor each with the tools you already know or with the following new options in this release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Featured images can be used in the cover block.</li><li>New featured image sizing controls make it easier to get the results you want.</li><li>While editing a template, at the root, or between blocks, the quick inserter shows you patterns and template parts to help you work faster and discover new layout options.</li><li>The query block supports filtering on multiple authors, support for custom taxonomies, and support for customizing what is shown when there are no results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Browsing footer patterns in the quick inserter\" class=\"wp-image-12890\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns will now appear when you need them in even more places, like in the quick inserter or when creating a new header or footer. If you’re a block theme author, you can even <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/\">register patterns from the Pattern Directory using `<code>theme.json</code>`</a>, enabling you to prioritize specific patterns that are most helpful to your theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Design Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design tools grow more powerful and intuitive with each release. Some highlights for 6.0 include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A new color panel design saves space, but still shows your options at a glance.&nbsp;</li><li>New border controls offer a simpler way to set your border exactly as you like it.&nbsp;</li><li>Transparency levels for your colors allow for even more creative color options.</li><li>Control gaps, margins, typography, and more on a collection of blocks, all at once, in the Group block.</li><li>Switch between stack, row, and group variations to position groups of blocks with more layout flexibility.</li><li>Use the gap support functionality in the Gallery block to create different looks – from adding spacing between all images, to removing spacing altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple blocks in the list view\" class=\"wp-image-12891\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New keyboard shortcuts enable you to select multiple blocks from the list view, modify them in bulk, and drag and drop them within the list. List View can be opened and closed easily; it comes collapsed by default and it automatically expands to the current selection whenever you select a block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unlocking the block in the block toolbar\" class=\"wp-image-12892\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Locking Controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can lock your blocks. Choose to disable the option to move a block, remove a block, or both. This simplifies project handover, allowing your clients to unleash their creativity without worrying about accidentally breaking their site in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Performance in WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes several updates focused on improving the performance of WordPress.

If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\"><em>WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</em></a>, for more details on this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer. Cause that almost always happens at these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) Now Available for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/wordpress-6-0-release-candidate-2-rc2-now-available-for-testing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 May 2022 18:06:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12840\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:171:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 is now available for testing!

Before the official release date, time is set aside for the community to perform final reviews and help test. Since the WordPress ecosystem includes thousands of plugins and themes, it is important that everyone within the WordPress community check to see if anything was missed along the way. That means the project would love your help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is planned for official release on May 24th, 2022, three weeks from today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.0 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-RC1.zip\">release candidate version here (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, 3, or 4, on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.0-RC1</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>What’s in WordPress 6.0 RC1?</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Beta 4, various items have been addressed, including (but not limited to):&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Backport updates of Comment blocks tests (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55643\">#55643</a>)</li><li>Backport a bugfix of Comment Template block pagination (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55658\">#55658</a>)</li><li>Editor: Backport bug fixes for WordPress 6.0 from Gutenberg (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567\">#55567</a>)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is the second major release for 2022, following 5.9 which became generally available in January. This release includes nearly 1,000 fixes and enhancements spanning most areas of the WordPress platform. Some key highlights within the content creation and site-building feature sets include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Style Switching:</strong> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/03/core-editor-improvement-choose-your-style/\">switch up the look and feel of your site</a>, all in one block theme. No need to change themes!</li><li><strong>More template options:</strong> use blocks to edit five more templates (author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy).</li><li><strong>Multi-select: </strong>Easily select text across multiple blocks. Edit to your liking.</li><li><strong>Retain Styles: </strong>Keep your custom styles in place, whether transforming between blocks or creating new buttons.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>More patterns in more places:</strong> the Quick Inserter surfaces patterns that might work well for the condition you’re in, baking in relevant patterns for template parts and pages you’re working on.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>List View improvements: </strong>New keyboard shortcuts (shift + click) let you select multiple blocks to modify in bulk (reposition, delete, etc.), see your content at a glance with a collapsed by default view, and more.</li><li><strong>Refined design tools: </strong>Explore<strong> </strong>a new color panel, transparency options, more group block variations to create new layout options (Stack, Row), the ability to set your featured image in a Cover block, control the exact size of your featured image, gap support for the Gallery block, and more.</li><li><strong>New blocks: </strong>Various Post Comments, Read More, No Results in Query Loop, Post Author Biography, Avatar blocks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Block Locking: </strong>Choose to disable the option to remove a block, move it, or both, right in the editor.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Export block themes: </strong>Explore the improved block theme export tool, as WordPress heads closer to codeless visual block theme building.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h1>Plugin and Theme Developers</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.0 RC1 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</a></em>, for more details on what’s contained in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a> This release also marks the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#hard-freeze\">hard string freeze</a> point of the 6.0 release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute to WordPress.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day. It marks the beginning of what is called the RC period, or release candidate period, for the current major release of the WordPress CMS. If you&#8217;re not super familiar with the way release cycles work, this is the point in the process where the code should pretty much be done changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can call in your designers, developers, and anyone else who builds things for others using your software. And they can either start testing their products on it, or they can figure out what new things they need to be able to teach their clients, whichever is most relevant to them. That is generally true for WordPress as well, but in true open source fashion, there is a caveat built in that helps us to get in last-minute, vital changes from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a two-person sign-off rule that&#8217;s been around for about as long as I can remember, but lets things be added late in the release cycle, as long as there are two sign-offs from qualified contributors. Most of the time, those qualified contributors are lead developers of the project, but not always. We have a good group of people who are around helping us make sure that this is doable and the best thing that we can offer to all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, two-person sign-off, that is the little bit of release process trivia that you never knew you needed. And since we&#8217;re looking at a release trivia, kind of hidden bits of how software is made, I actually have a guest with me today, Channing Ritter. So Channing is a product and visual designer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a design director at Automattic and has been working on the WordPress project as a full-time sponsored contributor since January, 2021. She is joining us to share some behind the scenes intel on what&#8217;s going into the 6.0 release, her role in that process, and then we&#8217;ll just kind of see how the conversation goes from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome Channing to the WordPress Briefing. Hi Channing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter </strong>00:02:45]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Josepha. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:02:48] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to have you here. If I understand, you are working on the design side of things with the release. So why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about the role you&#8217;ve played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:02:59] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. I am the design release lead for the 6.0 release. And if I understand correctly, this is a position that has been unfulfilled for the past few release cycles. So I&#8217;m kind of the first person to step in over the past few releases. And I think that&#8217;s really exciting, especially because design has started to play such a more important role in the WordPress project over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense that design would have a seat at the table, and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping advocate for the design team and learning from other folks on the release squad. Who&#8217;ve been doing this for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:03:33] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. First big question about 6.0, what is the feature that you are most excited about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:03:39] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most excited about the style switcher within the global styles panel. Um, so if folks still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about there, it&#8217;s the ability to change between different variations of the theme.json without actually switching the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a way to get a drastically different look and feels across your site with just a single click. And I see it as a really fun place to experiment and kind of get inspired for the different ways your site could appear without ever having to change your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of the Twenty Twenty-Two variations, they&#8217;re just really gorgeous and all so diverse. Like you have the main default theme that has the deep green and kind of peachy colors and this really elegant type treatment with a really thin Serif typeface. But then the variations are so different from that. And I think my favorite one is the Swiss variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:36]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss variation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, every graphic design nerd loves Swiss design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:42] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, ok! Now I know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really awesome things found in there. It&#8217;s a really high contrast, bold variation. It&#8217;s kind of black and white with red accents. I just love how different it is from the default style and how easy it is to change up your site and just get a whole drastically different look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:00] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. So for folks who do not know what we&#8217;re referring to, when we talk about the Twenty Twenty-Two variation, that is the default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. I&#8217;ll put a link to both the classic and block-based versions in our show notes, but you&#8217;ll want to use the block-based version to look at these style variations that Channing has mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:05:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re really excited that the first-ever default block theme was released with 5.9, which is when Twenty Twenty-Two first went out and was bundled with 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, with 6.0, I think even more so it&#8217;s starting to showcase the real power of block themes and what can actually be done there. And style variations is a huge kind of first step into this new world of block themes and starting to really open up the possibilities and all the flexibility that you have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:55] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. So when we&#8217;re talking about the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme, when we&#8217;re talking about switching these variations inside the theme itself, that seems to me to be a very user-focused kind of feature. And when we talk about users in WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of room for interpretation. Like if we look at it kind of in a framework of three types of users of WordPress, you have, like end-users. So people who are site owners using it as a site to, like, enable their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also have mid-end users—people who use it to build sites for others. And what I like to call back-end users, people who are using WordPress as a framework. And of course at the start of the Gutenberg project, way back in forever, a million years ago, one of the big calls to action that we had around even, like, trying to do this, was that we wanted to make WordPress easier for users. Just plain users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and to me, that means making WordPress easier for those mid-end users, people who are creating WordPress sites for other people. But also should give some power and autonomy back to those end-users, the people who are using sites to enable their business or are site owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:07:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that context, between 5.9 and 6.0, do you feel like we have features that are really giving that kind of power and agency back to our end-users? Do you feel like we have some features that are really focused on those mid-end users, as opposed to our backend users? For a long time, we focused heavily on enabling our backend users, and now Gutenberg kind of moves us into those other two areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so do you think that things like being able to switch between your style of variations, other things like that are moving us closer to that particular goal of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:07:51] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I think it&#8217;s both. I think some of the features being released in 6.0 are absolutely going to empower that end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly in terms of improvements around design tools and some of the quality of life improvements. For example, partially selecting across multiple blocks and being able to partially select texts there. That&#8217;s the type of thing that really brings the writing experience in the editor to be on par with how you would expect a text editing experience to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are tons of small quality of life improvements in this release that I think are really gonna help those end-users. But there are also improvements around what we might call the maintainers who are building sites for others. I think block locking in particular is something that is really going to start filling a gap between people who build the sites and then people who do the day-to-day maintenance within a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 6.0, we&#8217;re introducing some interface UI around block locking, but also there&#8217;ll be control around the ability to lock user roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:09:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think makes a lot of sense. I mean, we have all of these user roles in the CMS itself, and for a long time, we&#8217;ve just been like free for all on blocks, which was great and is great and should be available to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also if we are saying, like, it makes sense to have this gradient of users and their abilities for the CMS itself, and we are saying that we want to move control of the website and the content to be at the base layer in these blocks, then it also makes sense that we should be able to provide that same sort of granular level of access in the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a great thing. If you all, if dear listeners, you do not know what we mean by “block locking,” I&#8217;m sure that I can find a link for us in our show notes below as well. If for anyone who&#8217;s been talking through Gutenberg things with me for a while, you know that this is one of the primary use cases that I think has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:10:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the first examples that I offered to folks when we had that question of like, who is this being built for? In what way is this beneficial to that mid-end user, as opposed to just giving all of the power and autonomy to users in a way that maybe is not the best for their visitors?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those use cases that made the most sense to me being able to say, okay, well, the opportunity to, as somebody who runs an agency and is building websites for people to be able to say, yeah, ‘You can do anything that is possible in this instance of WordPress and all the things that you are allowed to do will not break your instance. It won&#8217;t break your website’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it gives a lot of time back to agencies to focus on their client&#8217;s most important problems, as opposed to not knowing how to update the hours in their footer or something like that. And so I&#8217;m very excited about that particular feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:11:01]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a long-requested feature. I mean, we&#8217;ve been hearing requests around this particular feature for years and, you know, often when something gets requested over a span of years like that, it&#8217;s because there are some complexities to figure out how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s definitely been the case with moving forward with block locking. And there are a lot of nuances there. But I think what you were saying, I totally agree with. There’s always a push and pull. And as we enable more and more flexibility for end-users, there needs to be a little bit of push from the other side to kind of give more granular controls, more locking options, and make sure that everything can still be easily maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:11:43]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we mentioned in that answer the concept of maintainers. If you are a contributor, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> kind of ‘maintainer.’ So if you&#8217;re a WordPress contributor and we said maintainers there, um, just know that that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re referring to. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say ‘contributor,’ there is a whole community of open source people and maintainers are people who specifically take care of a particular part of the WordPress software or the WordPress project, um, that makes all this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, ya know….&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:12:19] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So true! The maintainer has another meaning in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:12:20]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we have a mix in our audience and I love it, but it also makes me frequently spend like 10% of my podcast being like, by the way, when I said this, I didn&#8217;t mean you, but I did mean <em>you</em>, which makes it harder. I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. You’ve been with the project for a little bit, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time that you were, like, leading part of a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what would you say was the most challenging part of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:12:52] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great question. This is my first time being this closely involved with the release. Although I was involved with the 5.9 release, but mostly in a release assets capacity. So I helped with the <em>About Page</em> and the welcome banner that goes on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did get some insight in the last release cycle. Which was great preparation for being more involved as a release lead on this cycle. From the design perspective, one of the hardest things is always going to be figuring out what exactly goes into the release and what needs more time. In the sense, you know, that there might be some features that need to stay in the Gutenberg plugin for a while and get more testing before they get released to a much wider audience in a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the design side, we definitely have some goals that are big, long-term projects that are likely going to span across, you know, many releases, maybe even over many years. And I think the full site editor is a great example of that in a sense that it&#8217;s not something that you just were gone in one release and then it all gets released and then it&#8217;s all good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:14:06] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that has to be staggered across many releases, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it; does this make sense in this more limited capacity, and what else needs to go in in order for this feature to go in? And the most complex things about the WordPress project is how interconnected things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start making those decisions about what should go in, what should get pulled out, often there&#8217;s sort of a domino effect of like, well, that would affect this feature and then, well, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t go in, or maybe this does need to go in. And that is really one of the most challenging, but also one of the most fascinating aspects of the release process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:14:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. It is very, very true that there are kind of no small problems left in WordPress. *laughs* Yeah, when we, when we first started with this like bigger release squad, cause that has not been routine for the history of the project. When we first started with that, I know that expanding out the exposure to like how much one change affects 25 different things was really, it was really good for all of us to be reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top of our episode today, tomorrow begins the RC period. It begins the release candidate period, which is when it&#8217;s supposed to be, as locked down as possible. But if you all have been following along with our release process in general, which if you&#8217;re listening to this, you probably have, you know that last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had this whole question about the Webfonts API, and we had that conversation in a public space as best we could,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there are always things that you can&#8217;t, like, fully disclose in public spaces, but we had a very open and transparent conversation about, like, who is most affected by putting it in, in the state that the API was in. And, who&#8217;s most affected if we take it out. And where can we make compromises on either side so that both sides are a little happy and a little unhappy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:16:09] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like, that is all so hard to do. Not only in general. We have a 20-year-old code base and a five-year-old code base. And it&#8217;s all a big, big undertaking to understand what is happening and where it happens. And so there&#8217;s this moment always when we are trying to decide, like, is this baked enough? Did we put it in too early? Should we pull it out? How, if we pull it out, did we ask people to do too much work before we decided to pull it out anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you always have those kinds of questions about it. And honestly, I think that most of us weren&#8217;t around the last time, that WordPress was, was this experimental in public, like it&#8217;s always been open source. It&#8217;s always been experimental and iterating publicly, which is just the hardest way to work on anything. We like, we shipped our best guesses. Don&#8217;t be mad. It&#8217;ll be… we&#8217;re coming for it. We&#8217;re going to fix it. Like, that&#8217;s always hard, but the last time around, when it was this substantial a change was, like, 2008 or something, like, it was ages and ages ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:17:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were smaller than, we had a smaller number of contributors. We had a smaller group of people actually using the CMS. And so over time it has gotten more and more complicated. And, and I don&#8217;t think that we can ever understate the complexities of that. And so for you, you had a little bit of exposure to it in 5.9 and then showed up for like really doing it in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it been a surprising change? Like, were you surprised much more by how complicated it was when you were closer to it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:17:47] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. It’s been a real learning process, especially coming to understand how much there really are no easy answers. I think a lot of us are in the release squad are real problem solver types of people and, and want it to, you know, be a really neat, tidy answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not always the case. You know, sometimes parts of the feature might go in, or some contingency plan might get put into place and things didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. But what you said of being an experiment and being on kind of the cutting edge of trying out new things, I think there is a lot of passion around that in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in such a transitional period for the project, you know, moving from classic themes to block themes and really changing the ideas of how we approach designing sites. And because of that, I think there is a lot of momentum and energy around getting new features, as many new features as possible into each release. But there&#8217;s also, you know, a lot of testing and stuff that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make sure that, like you said, these things aren&#8217;t going out too early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:19:01] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and there&#8217;s always that difficulty, we&#8217;re going to just leap right into open source areas now. There&#8217;s always that difficulty around, like, there&#8217;s this concept that when, like, we always want to ship something that doesn&#8217;t break backward compatibility when possible, we don&#8217;t want to ship vulnerabilities. Like, that&#8217;s always true, but we are in an open source project, and open source projects are necessarily kind of tolerant of like, that&#8217;s not our best, but like it skates, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was, we aimed for Ferrari and got a skateboard because sometimes you got to start with a skateboard, right? *laughter* Like if it gets you from one place to another, that&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;ve got to aim some days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:19:45] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:19:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s always so, so difficult, especially cause, like, for the big change that 5.0 represented, and that 5.9 represented– 6.0 is not as big a shock as 5.9 was.&nbsp; But, like, as big a change as those represented, it still skates. And that&#8217;s, I think what makes the work especially hard, especially nuanced. And like, we haven&#8217;t gotten together as human beings in two years. And so sometimes people just kind of forget there&#8217;s a human being back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re humans. Everyone be nice. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that part of running a release definitely was surprising to me. My first release that I ran was 5.0 and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:20:31] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:20:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Yeah, it was, like, that was  2018. And then I became the executive director at the top of 2019. And I distinctly remember one core chat where I showed up and just was like the most transparent, vulnerable person we&#8217;ve ever experienced in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true. We have very vulnerable people in the project and very transparent people, but I told everyone like, there are a million of you and one of me, and it&#8217;s kind of terrifying that you&#8217;re leaping on me in this—like you&#8217;re scaring me a lot right now. And that was quite a thing to say to like, all these… it&#8217;s terrifying! Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:21:12] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love when you see that type of vulnerability in the project. I think it takes… it takes a degree of comfort and familiarity with the project to even be able to admit to that. And to me, that&#8217;s a real sign of growth in the project. Like when I first started contributing, I don&#8217;t think I ever would have just said, like, ‘How is the feature supposed to work? I have no idea.’ That&#8217;s something that I say all the time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Laughter*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, that is completely fine and more than okay. It&#8217;s a massive project. There are folks who have done deep thinking about a feature over the course of years. You know, and there are experts who can help shed light on various problems that maybe you just haven&#8217;t had a chance to dive into yet and really understand the nuances of yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the amazing thing about open source is that you can lean on folks who do have expertise in that particular area. You&#8217;re not expected to be an expert-expert in every single domain. It&#8217;s okay to say, I don&#8217;t really have a good idea or a good concept of this feature. I don&#8217;t have a good feeling for it. What do other folks think?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:22:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even people who have been in the project for a long time, decade plus, still say that all the time. You know, or you might just say, like, I have a really rough idea of how this works, are other people seeing this the same way? Or did other people have a different, you know, mental picture of how this might work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if, sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re over-communicating, it&#8217;s really helpful because often people do have really dramatically different ideas about how a feature might take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:22:49] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that&#8217;s one of the things that we never lose in the project. Like we are an old, old project now and we support a bunch of the web with a tiny, tiny group of people compared to the amount of the web that we support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that we always have that opportunity as senior leaders, which I am, and all of our upcoming leaders to all of us, just at some point, be like, can we stop the train? I don&#8217;t understand. I don’t understand that. Um, and not necessarily feel that that has made us a worse contributor. Cause I think that it&#8217;s when we are transparent about our lack of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we have the opportunity to make what we&#8217;re offering to the world more solid and always better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:23:35] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. I think it&#8217;s the, one of the most lovely things about the WordPress community. There&#8217;s really low judgment around those types of questions and people are really inclusive and more than happy to take a moment to explain something to you or shed some light on an issue you might not have thought that much about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the best things you can always reach out for help. And folks are always willing to provide guidance or context or even historical information about, you know, whether it&#8217;s been tried in the past or previous explorations and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:24:10] </p>\n\n\n\n<p> All right. Well, that covers all of my questions for you. Do you have a final thought about the release that you would like to share with everyone you don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to, not everyone has like a final sign off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:24:25] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. One of the things I&#8217;m most excited about for this 6.0 release is all of the improvements around design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are just small improvements around a ton of different things, like the color panel, border controls, gap support, typography options, flexible container blocks, etc. These are the types of tools that are a designer&#8217;s dream. You know, they really make the difference between being able to make a really crisp, finished looking final product and having something that&#8217;s a little rough around the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a designer, like those are the things that your eye goes straight towards. And all of these nuanced new tools, they really allow designers to have that fine detailed control to create really pixel perfect sites. And I think that&#8217;s something that, you know, myself and a lot of others on the design team are just so beyond excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:25]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Well, Channing, thank you so much for joining us today on the WordPress Briefing; it has been an absolute delight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:25:32] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:41] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it is time, woohoo, for the small list of big things. My favorite part of this podcast, that&#8217;s not true. I have a lot of things that I love about this podcast. I just, in particular love being able to share like three things that are coming up in the next couple of weeks that everybody should be aware of. And I really particularly like the list I have this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as of today, we are two weeks away from WordSesh. If you&#8217;re looking forward to your first in-person WordPress event, but feel like you could use a little foundation information, a little bit of a WordPress primer, then this event has a lot of excellent thought leaders in the project that you can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more practical or hands-on opportunities, uh, you can also check out social learning spaces. All of those are free for anyone. So I will include links to both of them in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:26:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, as of today, we are four weeks away from WordCamp Europe. This is one of our flagship events. So it also includes a contributor day, which I encourage you to look into. If you have never heard of one before. I will be there to meet some of the contributors that have joined the project since the end of 2019. And hopefully, I will see you there as well. If you&#8217;ve never heard of a contributor day, then I&#8217;ll include a link to the beginner&#8217;s guide to contributions, a little talk that I gave in 2017 in the show notes that should help you get your bearings or at the very least know what questions to ask yourself to figure out if a contributor day is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing as of today, it has been one week since <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">Meta</a> developers… Um, that sounds like a band… Ian Dunn and the Meta developers connected the props channel in the community Slack to WordPress.org profile activity. I&#8217;m really excited about this. It&#8217;s the first in a long list of changes that are part of a larger project to credit more non-code contributions, more contributions that are not specific to a major release or event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to set us up to be able to provide more quality checks and balances for our growing Five for the Future program. If you&#8217;ve not been over there lately, if you&#8217;re not super sure what I&#8217;m talking about, there&#8217;s a link to the discussion post that we had about it, but also you can wander right over into the Making WordPress Slack and check out the props channel to just kind of see a running list of contributors that people are really grateful for.

From using the software as a basic website tool to helping entrepreneurs and good causes around the world fulfill their aspirations, she has overcome personal barriers and now aims to inspire others.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher found her vocation and learned new skills through WordPress. She also discovered a way to encourage other women to consider careers in IT.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opening the doors to a career in technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, Meher was diagnosed with dyslexia (difficulty in reading the written word) and dyscalculia (difficulty in comprehending numbers and mathematical functions). With the support of her parents and a tutor, she was able to overcome this learning obstacle. She developed coping techniques and a determination to work to overcome challenges as they appeared later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school, she got an opportunity to replace one subject with computer studies as an alternative. This proved to be an eye-opener to future career possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began to research not only what the internet had to offer but also how it worked, including the new and fascinating concepts of email and websites. Her father bought the family’s first desktop computer so she could do her research at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher’s father wanted to turn her love for computers into something that would serve her well in the future. In 2005, he enrolled her in a short computer course from a global IT training provider. The course tutor was so impressed with her performance, she was advised to enroll in a four year software development course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant she had studied the software development course alongside her higher education college course. Looking back, she enjoyed the dual challenge of the degree course in commerce, and the experience prepared her well to keep learning software while working as a developer. Within three years, she had learned C#, C, C++, HTML, Java, and .NET. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, she was in a dilemma to choose between commerce and IT. What to choose? She had a compulsory one-year technology internship to complete, and her choice of focus for that year would prove to be a defining moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, on her birthday, Meher was offered an internship. On the first day of the internship, she was introduced to WordPress. Her initial assignment was to change the look and feel of the WordPress dashboard — in just six hours. But there was a problem &#8211; she had never worked with WordPress before!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I stared at the whiteboard and thought that task given was impossible and difficult to meet the deadline. I wondered if my boss was joking and did not know then what you could do with WordPress as a developer and how it could slot into your toolbox. It opened my eyes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher used her research skills to know more about using WordPress. She found a plugin that would help her achieve her task. She met the deadline and it ingrained an interest that she would never lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Re-discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after her initial WordPress experience, Meher was assigned to lead an international project in WordPress.&nbsp;She was hesitant — she had lost touch with the CMS during that five years, but the project was a great opportunity to become a team leader and lead from the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She decided to update her WordPress skills, relying again on the strength of her research skills and determination. In the process, she also taught her team all about WordPress, inspiring many of those members to continue to develop their WordPress skill set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of that project was a pivotal moment for Meher and a new dawn as a developer specializing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team lead, Meher soon found it was not possible to always have all the answers straight away. She found internet searches gave practical solutions—but rarely explained the theory behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So she went looking for a WordPress group to help her expand the scope and depth of her knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the community and its developer learning opportunities </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"999\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=999%2C667&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher at WordCamp Nagpur in 2017\" class=\"wp-image-12762\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher enjoying being part of <em>WordCamp Nagpur in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, while browsing Facebook, Meher came across an advertisement for something called WordCamp Mumbai, an event that had taken two days before. She did a little digging to learn what a WordCamp was, and about the people behind it. She took the plunge and joined the WordPress Mumbai Meetup group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first Meetup experience was not love at first sight. She felt the topics were for advanced users, and the timing late in the evening made it difficult to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few months later, the Meetup addressed a topic that could help her resolve an issue in one of her current projects. She made the effort to show up and came away with a number of important tips.&nbsp;The speaker had taken the time to speak to individual attendees. When he came to Meher, she took the opportunity to ask a couple of questions about her project issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter she went to more Meetups and got to know the people behind this group, just as they started talking about WordCamp Mumbai 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A WordCamp adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher pictured with the WordCamp Mumbai 2016 sign \" class=\"wp-image-12758\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher discovering <em>WordCamps in Mumbai in 2016</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher expressed interest in being a part of the coming&nbsp; WordCamp Mumbai and started in an entry-level role with basic responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, she thought WordCamp was a formal conference with about 100 people. So on the first day of WordCamp Mumbai 2016, she was surprised to see so many WordCamp enthusiasts attending and enjoying such a relaxed and friendly conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that great experience, Meher went to many more meetups and did more volunteering. She started taking on responsibilities in the coming WordCamps and getting to know the different aspects of the camp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following years, at each WordPress, she took up a new role like speaker vetting, sponsors, and volunteer coordination. This allowed her to know more about what an organizer needs to do, from planning to execution, to make WordCamp a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Mumbai 2017 group photo of the team\" class=\"wp-image-12765\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>With the team at <em>WordCamp Mumbai in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher is grateful for her WordPress journey which was fostered in the Mumbai community. It has been filled with beautiful surprises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask why she’s chosen to specialize professionally in WordPress, Meher says WordPress is easy to teach a non-technical person, yet it is still highly customizable. Being a WordPress developer has given her the opportunity to work&nbsp; remotely for global web development companies that let her think out of the box. And she learns new skills with every release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The community makes WordPress special</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher says that some of her most memorable WordPress moments have revolved around special friendships, trying new things, and participating in community building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has let her explore different parts of India, make new friends locally and internationally, and encourage women to be a part of meetup groups and events across India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Meher’s biggest dreams was to lead WordCamp Mumbai as a lead organizer and show others what could be achieved by working together in open source. In 2019, she did just that and has volunteered at international WordCamps and meetups since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher speaking at WordCamp Mumbai 2019\" class=\"wp-image-12731\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Taking to the stage at WordCamp Mumbai in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of her enthusiasm for sharing the opportunities WordPress can give people, especially women, she has given time to co-organize two global <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation month long events</a> and contributor events in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher said: “I was first introduced to translation at one of the meetups which was organised to support the WordPress Translation Day. I realized this was another way to support my local communities and bring the power of WordPress to them by contributing in Gujarati and Hindi. I did not imagine I would a few years later be a global organizer for the event itself!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her commitment to ongoing learning as a developer and to model what she believes about the value and community growth opportunities of open source, Meher has given time and energy to the Marketing Team, where she has been a Team Rep, to the Training Team, and to the Core Team contributing to multiple releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The developer adventure with WordPress is unlimited</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the start of my software developer journey, I always thought the C++ and Java were the only skills you required to excel in your career. From the time I started exploring WordPress in depth, I realized the potential and the power of WordPress in web development.</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a part of the WordPress community, Meher learned that there is so much more than just building blogs on WordPress. She started exploring different features of WordPress, created her first theme, and eventually specialized as a frontend specialist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher now works as a consultant and front end developer with an international agency specializing in WordPress. Asked what she thought was the best thing about being a WordPress developer, Meher replied: &#8220;Through WordPress, I have an opportunity to build unique out of the box websites and work&nbsp;remotely for global web development companies that encourages you to think out of the box. There is always opportunity to continuously advance my coding skills and learn new techniques with every release.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that there is no limit to where using the software can take you and what you can combine it with to find solutions to projects big and small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn a living from WordPress, her advice is from the heart: try to give back to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am sure you will learn or teach something new and definitely make friends across the world. There is no shame in making mistakes, as you can learn from them and develop your skills further.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:39] </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So you&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a while. You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning; you may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or, maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their project or business. Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have long since outgrown that, but even 19 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because even after those 19 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same. And that is to democratize publishing, to help people have a place online where they can tell their stories or share their projects or set up their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today. And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, oh, Josepha, how old fashioned? I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first ever website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, and some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first. Cause, like, if you want the domain name, wordpress.org, like we own that, you can have that! But if you know that you want a domain like WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com, like that one might be more available. And if you know the kind of words you want in your domain, you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:09]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mentioned all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it’s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start, before you even know what WordPress is most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service where they will keep your WordPress software up to date, provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong. So it ranges all the way from full service like that all the way down to essentially zero services, just kind of hands-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site. But they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you. They leave updating up to you, things like. So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself. And the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software and what you want and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either service with the existing hosts that you chose or moving to a different host; however that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:10]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, the other side of that spectrum that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server or, or you know how to work in this thing called c-panel, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to wordpress.org/download, and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got you covered. In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the Learn WP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host as well as various other early steps of this process. So if you felt like I blazed through all of that, which honestly I kind of did, you can work through those lessons in that course, at your own pace, and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this ‘Hello World’ post– there&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page, exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMS in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got now a website, we know, kind of, how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can kind of be moderated and stuff. And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it&#8217;s not a fun task, if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some, choose your own adventure guiding questions here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words, mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to wordpress.org/themes and and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to wordpress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically so that you can see how things look right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site. So if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely and just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every word, press instance ships with a theme and it is fully functional when you, when you get your site up and running. So you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites is to add plugins to them. So plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want, what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need. Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there; if that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a general side note here, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell you this. I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes and on the one hand you definitely can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem. And obviously, here, are some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time. Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009 and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. So I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the easiest of the hard options for CMS. Like content management systems are just complicated, but we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game, like you should have had a website for years. I mean, sure that could be true. And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. But the second-best time to plant that tree is today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:12:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, the next release of WordPress, WordPress 6.0, has reached its beta phase. That means the full focus is on finding and fixing the bugs we accidentally created during this development cycle. Beta two comes out tomorrow and you can follow along in the core channel in the Making WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen how those releases get packaged, and if you just want to keep an eye on what everybody&#8217;s doing so that you can be the first to know, yeah, Making WordPress Slack is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list is that speaking of WordPress 6.0, we had the public walk through a couple of weeks ago, which means that in a few weeks, I&#8217;ll do a WordPress 6.0 sneak peek. I&#8217;ll share some highlights of the release features and why I think they are super important for you to take a look. Sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:13:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final, big thing, if you are new to WordPress and this episode has you all fired up to start your blog, we have a bunch of contributors over on the Learn WP team that have just the thing for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join the online social learning space called How to Make a WordPress Blog. It&#8217;s a free online event that will help you get started. I&#8217;ll link the information in the show notes below. And I&#8217;ll also share in the show notes, a list of WordPress Meetup groups, where you can find more opportunities to learn and get support from other people locally who are also doing things with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also find a list in the dashboard of your newly installed WordPress blog you no doubt have after this podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things.

Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you test Beta 1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Option 1: Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</li><li>Option 2: Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-beta1.zip\">beta version here (zip)</a>.</li><li>Option 3: Use WP-CLI to test: <code>wp core update --version=6.0-beta1</code>. <br><strong><em>Do not use this option if your filesystem is case-insensitive.</em></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release is May 24, 2022, which is about six weeks away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep WordPress Bug Free – Help with Testing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. If you have never tested a beta release before, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/04/12/help-wanted-test-wordpress-6-0/\">this detailed guide</a> will walk you through how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps make sure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. And anyone can do it – especially great WordPress community members just like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one? Read about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives</a> that happen in Make Core. You can also join a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/\">publicly-accessible channel</a> on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com\">Making WordPress Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. If you are comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">file one on WordPress Trac</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was checking the list of upcoming events recently as part of just my regular work and saw that the call for organizers for WordCamp Asia is open. On the one hand, it made my heart skip a beat with excitement. That event is six years or so in the making. And on the other hand, it reminded me of February 10th, 2020, the day that Matt told me that we had to proactively cancel WordCamp Asia. That week was truly heartbreaking for me as well as I think the entire organizing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also, fortunately, was prescient. As I think back over the two years since then, I&#8217;m grateful for our community wranglers and deputies who have consistently hosted important discussions about how to return to in-person events safely. And with two of our major flagship events returning this year, I&#8217;m here to summarize, sort of, what the rules and guidelines are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But certainly I hope that you come away from this with an idea of what&#8217;s being done to keep everyone safe as we are best able.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, before we dig into specifics, I want to be clear upfront that the guidelines for COVID-aware events are mandatory, unless otherwise stated. For folks who&#8217;ve been attending WordPress events, or participating in the community for a long time, this is a change. As a program, we have always done our best to be flexible with guidelines so that we can prioritize local knowledge. But our responsibility is to the long-term success of this community and this program. So moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of our community members poses risks to the program itself. So with that in mind, let&#8217;s learn what we&#8217;re going to see at events for the rest of the.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any WordPress event that is gathering more than 50 people, the new mandatory guidelines are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, follow local laws and guidelines. If your area has suggested guidelines on top of the mandatory ones, follow those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, is if you are in a location where laws or guidelines require or permit venues to limit admission based on a person&#8217;s vaccination status and masking, then events can only happen in venues that are willing to provide staff to check for vaccination status at the door. And then also to remind participants to wear masks during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is if your area or venue legally cannot check vaccination status, your area must pass the in-person checklist, which I will link in the show notes below. But that in-person checklist has to be passed at the time of the application and then again at the time of the event. And in addition to that, the venue must be willing to provide staff who will remind participants to wear masks and check for temperature during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers in these areas must be prepared to move online or cancel if the region fails the safety checklist, which again, will be linked in the show notes below. So those are the three things and they are pretty dense, but also I think allow for a fair amount of flexibility. There is also a tidy flow chart linked in the sidebar of make.wordpress.org/community that will help you to decide what sort of event your own area can support right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the mandatory guidelines for WordPress events in general right now, but you probably also have a few specific questions. So I&#8217;ve got the three most common questions ready to go with answers from Angela Jin who helped me to kind of pull together the information for this particular podcast props to Angela. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first question, anything specific to know about WordCamp Europe? WordCamp Europe will be following these guidelines as well. All attendees and participants are expected to wear a mask while they are at the event and catering will be offered outside so people can remove their masks to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second common question is how will these guidelines change as countries and local governments begin deescalating restrictions and safety measures? We should consider these guidelines to be subject to evolution based on what the team is hearing and seeing from the community. But right now we intend to keep these stricter guidelines in place until we see how the loosened rules play out elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a third frequent question is what&#8217;s going to happen to all these online events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team will continue to support online events right now. So if your community doesn&#8217;t feel ready to have an in-person event, but still wants to kind of get everyone together that is still allowed, and still&nbsp; encouraged. And finally the community team will continue to keep a close eye on situations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it becomes safe to do so, and your community is interested, they of course will be happy to chat with you about a WordCamp. There is an application that I will share the link to in the show notes below as well. In case that is something that your community is wanting to look into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I have a little postscript also. I know I was like finally, and now I&#8217;m doing a finally, finally. That&#8217;s what postscripts are about. P.S. If you have not stopped by the community team’s site or any of their meetings, they&#8217;ve been doing a really great job of keeping things moving through two years of unpredictable changes. If you are a community team member, I want to offer you a huge thanks. Thank you so much for helping us to stay aware and able to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an organizer, pat yourself on the back. I want to thank you for pivoting with us, moving through online events, even though they are not at all the same as in-person events and certainly they don&#8217;t share the reasons that we get people together sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you are an end to end attendee, if you go to WordPress meetups or you go to any sort of WordPress online events or WordCamps, anything like that, thank your local organizer. They have been doing this probably for a while, and I&#8217;m sure that they are looking forward to getting back to in-person events themselves, but even, so they have been putting in a lot of volunteer hours to help make sure that we all know how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so find them, thank them, and I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, it is time for our small list of big things. Number one, WordCamp Asia has a call for organizers open! This event will be in 2023. And I think that we all simply cannot wait. So I&#8217;ll link the call for organizers in the show notes. And then of course you can follow that whole site to stay up to date on what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is, while we&#8217;re on the topic of events, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about how we can best support organizers who are getting back to in-person events. We&#8217;d like thoughts from both organizers and attendees. So feel free to drop by and leave a note in the comments section. And while you&#8217;re over there, the third thing in my small list of big things, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about regional events. So go over there, get all your thoughts about WordPress events together. Get them all sorted out in one go. Just leave comments, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All over the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most embarrassing WordCamp story actually has to do with where I was supposed to be versus where people thought I was supposed to be. This was early on in my time with WordPress, with Automattic. And I had convinced someone, I had convinced a colleague and friend of mine to go to my home WordCamp, WordCamp Fayetteville over there in Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I didn&#8217;t go. But I knew I wasn&#8217;t going, I knew I was going to WordCamp Boston, but he did not know that I was not going to go. And so he arrived at WordCamp Fayetteville, WordCamp Northwest Arkansas. I can&#8217;t remember what it was called at the time. And immediately was confused about where I was and why I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there was this excellent moment of mass confusion among states where the folks at WordCamp Fayetteville started tweeting about how I had convinced this contributor to go to that event and then didn&#8217;t show up. And then the folks at WordCamp Boston, we&#8217;re looking at all of those tweets, because if you are a WordCamp organizer, you are always looking at the tweets from all the other WordCamps happening in your weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people got very confused about why I was in Boston while they were thinking that I was in Fayetteville, even though the tweets were talking about how, like, I wasn&#8217;t in Fayetteville. They probably didn&#8217;t say that it was probably more along the lines of like, “Hey, let&#8217;s share a photo with Josepha” to, like, make fun of the fact that I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I caused mass confusion in multiple states. That&#8217;s probably my most embarrassing WordCamp story. You&#8217;re welcome. Bye!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12506\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 08:44:12 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 01:44:48 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20220125202620\";}', 'no');
