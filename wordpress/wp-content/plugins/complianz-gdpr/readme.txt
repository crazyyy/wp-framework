== Frequently asked questions ==
= Knowledgebase =
Complianz maintains a continuously growing knowledgebase about GDPR, CCPA and COPPA on [complianz.io](https://complianz.io)

= Is my website GDPR, COPPA, CCPA, DSGVO, AVG, UK-GDPR, PECR compliant with this plugin? =
We cannot guarantee GDPR/COPPA/CCPA/UK-GDPR/PECR compliance for your website.
= When do I need a Cookie Notice? =
Complianz | GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent will determine this automatically. Regarding the GDPR, when you are using cookies that store personal data you always have to explicitly ask consent to the user. When you anonymize every single bit of data you don’t have to. Functional cookies don’t require the consent of the user as they are only placed for functional purposes. For the United Kingdom explicit consent for statistics is required, even when IP addresses have been anonymized.
Regarding CCPA, you always have to show which cookies you are using but there's no obligation in asking consent.
= Do I always need a consent checkbox on contact forms? =
Not always. The Complianz Privacy Suite Premium plugin can determine if you need this, based on your answers. It mainly depends on the type of information you request.
= What are functional cookies? =
A functional cookie is a cookie which is needed for the technical functioning of the website. Cookies that are used to track if something is placed in the cart, or if a user is logged in are functional cookies. There is no need to request permission for this kind of cookies, nor is there any need to describe them in your cookie policy (although we think that is a good idea).
= What are analytical cookies? =
Analytical cookies are used to track visitors on the website. How do they browse, how long are they staying, and what are they looking at, e.g. Also demography is part of an analytical cookie. They are essential in measuring the usage of a website and to optimize it. They can be seen as real management instruments.
= What are advertising, marketing or tracking cookies? =
Advertising, or marketing cookies, are cookies that are being placed for advertising purposes. Advertising cookies can never be set without consent. These cookies are only being used for advertising purposes.
Our plugin decides whether a cookie consent banner has to be shown. So you shouldn’t need to worry when using our plugin.
= What is the GDPR? =
The GDPR is a regulation within the EU law on privacy and data protection for any citizen within the EU and European Economic Area. It aims primarily on giving control to individuals over their personal data. The GDPR also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU.
= What is the CCPA? =
The CCPA (Californian Privacy Act) is a law set up by the Californian government. The law is adjudged to be one of the toughest and farthest-reaching consumer privacy laws in the US. It is mostly focused on giving insights on what personal data business gather and how to protect and control these personal data.
= What is COPPA? =
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a law designed to protect the online privacy of children under 13. It was set up in the 1990's and states that website owners have to meet certain requirements regarding visitors with the age under 13.
= What is PECR & UK-GDPR? =
PECR (UK) covers the use of cookies and similar technologies for storing information and accessing information stored, on a user’s equipment such as a computer or mobile device.
= Can I create a Cookie Wall with this plugin? =
With some custom CSS this is possible, but we do not consider a cookie wall to be GDPR compliant, so it's not actively supported. We do, however, have the option to create a Soft Cookie Wall. Which blocks interaction with the website, but dismissing remains a possibility.
