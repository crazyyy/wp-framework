== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use this plugin? =

Use this plugin if you want to get rid of WordPress' "Category base" completely. The normal behaviour of WordPress is to add '/category' to your category permalinks if you leave "/category" blank in the Permalink settings. So your category links look like `mydomain.com/category/my-category/`. With this plugin your category links will look like `mydomain.com/my-category/` (or `mydomain.com/my-category/sub-category/` in case of sub categories).

= Will it break any other plugins? =

As far as I can tell, no. I have been using this on several blogs for a while and it doesn't break anything.

= Won't this conflict with pages? =

Simply don't have a page and category with the same slug. Even if they do have the same slug it won't break anything, just the category will get priority (Say if a category and page are both 'xyz' then `mydomain.com/xyz/` will give you the category). This can have an useful side-effect. Suppose you have a category 'news', you can add a page 'news' which will show up in the page navigation but will show the 'news' category.

= The plugin has been uninstalled, but the slug /category/ did not reappear why? =

A particular installation does not allow the rewrite feature in disabling the plugin. Try after disabling the plugin, save permanent links again.
