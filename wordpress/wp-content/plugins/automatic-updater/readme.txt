Adds extra options to WordPress' built-in Automatic Updates feature.

== Description ==

Advanced Automatic Updates adds extra options to WordPress' built-in Automatic Updates feature. On top of security updates, it also supports installing major releases, plugins, themes, or even regular SVN checkouts!

If you're working on a WordPress Multisite install, it will properly restrict the options page to your Network Admin.

While this will be useful for the vast majority of sites, please exercise caution, particularly if you have any custom themes or plugins running on your site.

== Installation ==

= The Good Way =

1. In your WordPress Admin, go to the Add New Plugins page
1. Search for: advanced automatic updates
1. Advanced Automatic Updates should be the first result. Click the Install link.

= The Old Way =

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

= The Living-On-The-Edge Way =

(Please don't do this in production, you will almost certainly break something!)

1. Checkout the current development version from http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/automatic-updater/trunk/
1. Subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/automatic-updater?limit=100&mode=stop_on_copy&format=rss) to be notified of changes

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the debug email going to the admin email address, instead of the override email address? =

The debug email doesn't provide a filter to allow changing the email address it's being sent to. This will hopefully change in a future release of WordPress, you can follow progress in [this ticket](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25756).
