== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= SVG not rendering inline since 2.3 update =
Ensure "Advanced Mode" is enabled in Settings > SVG Support.

= How do I disable the Javascript on the front end if I am not using inline SVG? =
Disable "Advanced Mode" in the settings.

= I'm trying to use SVG in the customizer but it's not working. =
To allow SVG to work in the customizer, you will need to modify/add some code in your child theme's function file. [Here is a great tutorial](https://thebrandid.com/using-svg-logos-wordpress-customizer/) on how to do that. The important part is:
`
'flex-width'	=> true
'flex-height'	=> true
`

= How do I add animation to my SVG? =
You will need to edit your SVG file in a code editor so you can add CSS classes to each element you need to target within the SVG. Make sure that your IMG tag is being swapped out for your inline SVG and then you can use CSS or JS to apply animations to elements within your SVG file.

= Why is SVG Support not working in multisite? =
If you installed multisite prior to WordPress 3.5, then you will need to remove your ms-files. Here is a couple of resources to help you: [Dumping ms-files](http://halfelf.org/2012/dumping-ms-files/) [Removing ms-files after 3.5](https://www.yunomie.com/2298/removing-ms-files-php-after-upgrading-an-existing-multisite-installation-to-3-5/).

= Why is my SVG not working in Visual Composer? =
If you are using SVG Support with Visual Composer or any other page builders, you will need to make sure that you can add your own class to the image. The easiest way to do this is by using a simple text or code block in the builder to put your image code in to. Additionally, there is now a setting to force all SVG files to be rendered inline.

= How do I get this to work with the Media Library Assistant plugin? =
You need to add the mime type for svg and svgz to: "MLA Settings > Media Library Assistant > Uploads (tab)" and then it works.
