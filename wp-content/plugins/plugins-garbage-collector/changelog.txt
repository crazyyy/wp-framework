=== Changes List ===

= 0.12 [15.08.2020] =
* Update: Server side "Fatal error: Maximum execution time of NN seconds exceeded" should not take place now. PGC scans plugins with large quantity of files by splitting job to smaller parts per 500 files.
* Update: "foreign key constraint fails" error should not prevent database table deletion. PGC temporally switches off "foreign keys constraints checking".
* Fix: Known database tables with DB prefix 'wp_' inside name (like wp_pro_quiz_question from LearnDash LMS) were not recognized. Code had used str_replace( $db_prefix, '', $table_name ) to exclude DB prefix from the table name and broke the name itself.

= 0.11.1 [23.06.2020] =
* Fix: Checkbox to mark table for deletion was not shown, if table belongs to the known, but unused (uninstalled) plugin.
* Fix: Plugin state translation is made now exactly before output, to use its value in the code logic safely.

= 0.11. [19.06.2020] =
* New: "Tools->Plugins Garbage Collector" menu item was renamed to "Tools->Database Cleanup"
* New: Multisite support was added. It's safe to use PGC at the single sites of the WordPress multisite network.
* New: PGC uses the list of known database tables and list of plugins which do not create own database tables. 
This reduces files scanning time as plugins known for PGC are not scanned for database tables usage. PGC checks these lists updates once a day. There is an intent to extend/update known plugins list on the regular base.
* New: It's possible to hide (temporally exclude from the listing) any found database table. Earlier this feature was available only for the tables belong to the active plugins. You can use this feature to hide the tables which are known for you, but are not recognized by PGC. Thanks for reporting such cases to vladimir@shinephp.com
* Update: Call to deprecated function mysql_get_server_info() was excluded.
* Update: PGC shows database tables in the original format, without converting them all to lowercase letters.
* Fix: Last item in the installed plugins list ( item C in the list (A, B, C) ) was never scanned for database tables. Db tables created by such plugin were always shown as belong to unknown plugin.
