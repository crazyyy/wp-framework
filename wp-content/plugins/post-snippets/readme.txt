Create WordPress custom snippets shortcodes and reusable content and insert them in into your posts and pages.

== Description ==

> Create custom shortcodes and reusable content and insert them in into your posts and pages.

This plugin lets you build a library with snippets of HTML, PHP code or reoccurring text that you often use in your posts and pages. You can use predefined variables to replace parts of the snippet on insert. All snippets are available in the post editor via a button in the Visual mode. The snippet can be inserted as defined, or as a shortcode to keep flexibility for updating the snippet. PHP code is supported for snippets inserted as shortcodes.

= Basic Features =

* **Insert** All defined snippets is inserted from a button directly in the post editor.
* **Shortcodes** You can use this plugin to create your own custom shortcodes.
* **PHP** A shortcode snippet can optionally be processed as PHP code.
* **Buttons** The snippets can be found in the (visual) WordPress editor with a button and in the HTML editor with a quicktag.
* **User-friendly** Easy to use 'Manage Snippets' page where you can add, edit and remove snippets.
* **Variables** Each snippet can have as many custom variables as you like, which can be used on insert.
* **Import/Export** Snippets can be imported and exported between sites.
* **Documentation** Full documentation is available directly from the help panel in the plugin (top right in WordPress).
* **Uninstall** If you delete the plugin from your plugins panel it cleans up all data it has created in the WordPress database.

= Premium Features =
* **Snippet duplication** Easily duplicate shortcode snippets and insert them into posts and pages.
* **Rich Text Editor** Use Post Snippetsâ€™ built-in Rich Text editor to customize your snippets however you want.
* **Snippets Order** Change the order of your snippets simply by using the drag and drop functionality.
* **Rest API** Allow anyone the right to add, edit, update and delete any snippet without providing them admin access.
* **Tags** Use the tags feature to add multiple tags and filter different snippets by using tags.
* **Cloud snippet** Save, edit, download, and delete snippets directly on the cloud by using the cloud snippets feature.
* **Gutenberg Block Editor Support** Gutenberg block types can support any number of built-in core features such as name, icon, description, category and more.
* **Snippet type** Display the snippet types (PHP, JS, CSS) by adding a column in the snippet listing page.

3. Go to Settings > Post Snippets and start entering your snippets.

1. Deactivate Post Snippets in the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
2. Select Post Snippets in the 'Recently Active Plugins' section and select
   'Delete' from the 'Bulk Actions' drop down menu.
3. This will delete all the plugin files from the server as well as erasing all

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I the documentation? =

Documentation for the plugin is available directly from the Help panel in the
plugin administration screen (top right corner of WordPress).

= Why does importing Snippets on a Multisite installation fail? =

Uploading of zip files must be allowed, enable this in Sites Network Admin > Settings > Upload Settings > Upload file types.

= How can I use the content in an enclosed shortcode? =

If the shortcode is enclosed and contains content between the tags in a post. Example: `[shortcode]Some text[/shortcode]` the text within will be available in a variable called content. So in your snippet use {content} to display it. Don't enter 'content' in the variable field, it's automatically assigned.

= Where can I get support? =

Please visit the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/post-snippets) for questions, answers, support and feature requests.

= Can I disable the PHP Code Execution feature? =

To disable the "PHP Code" execution feature in this plugin, add the following code your theme's functions.php or to wp-config.php: `define('POST_SNIPPETS_DISABLE_PHP', true);`

This is useful if you are using this plugin for client sites, and don't want
your clients to be able to use PHP code in a post snippet.
