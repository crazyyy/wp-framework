== Description ==

> Create custom shortcodes and reusable content and insert them in into your posts and pages.

This plugin lets you build a library with snippets of HTML, PHP code or reoccurring text that you often use in your posts and pages. You can use predefined variables to replace parts of the snippet on insert. All snippets are available in the post editor via a button in the Visual mode. The snippet can be inserted as defined, or as a shortcode to keep flexibility for updating the snippet. PHP code is supported for snippets inserted as shortcodes.

* **Shortcodes** You can use this plugin to create your own custom shortcodes.
* **PHP** A shortcode snippet can optionally be processed as PHP code.
* **Buttons** The snippets can be found in the (visual) WordPress editor with a button and in the HTML editor with a quicktag.
* **User-friendly** Easy to use 'Manage Snippets' page where you can add, edit and remove snippets.
* **Variables** Each snippet can have as many custom variables as you like, which can be used on insert.
* **Import/Export** Snippets can be imported and exported between sites.
* **Documentation** Full documentation is available directly from the help panel in the plugin (top right in WordPress).
* **Uninstall** If you delete the plugin from your plugins panel it cleans up all data it has created in the WordPress database.

= Premium Features =
* **Snippet duplication** Easily duplicate shortcode snippets and insert them into posts and pages.
* **Rich Text Editor** Use Post Snippets’ built-in Rich Text editor to customize your snippets however you want.
* **Snippets Order** Change the order of your snippets simply by using the drag and drop functionality.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I the documentation? =

Documentation for the plugin is available directly from the Help panel in the
plugin administration screen (top right corner of WordPress).

= Why does importing Snippets on a Multisite installation fail? =

Uploading of zip files must be allowed, enable this in Sites Network Admin > Settings > Upload Settings > Upload file types.

= How can I use the content in an enclosed shortcode? =

If the shortcode is enclosed and contains content between the tags in a post. Example: `[shortcode]Some text[/shortcode]` the text within will be available in a variable called content. So in your snippet use {content} to display it. Don't enter 'content' in the variable field, it's automatically assigned.

= Where can I get support? =

Please visit the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/post-snippets) for questions, answers, support and feature requests.

= Can I disable the PHP Code Execution feature? =

To disable the "PHP Code" execution feature in this plugin, add the following code your theme's functions.php or to wp-config.php: `define('POST_SNIPPETS_DISABLE_PHP', true);`

This is useful if you are using this plugin for client sites, and don't want
your clients to be able to use PHP code in a post snippet.

= Version 1.4 - 10 Apr 2009 =
 * Added a checkbox for Shortcodes (SC) in the admin panel. When checking this
   one a dynamic shortcode will be generated and inserted instead of the
   snippet, which allows snippets to be updated later on for all posts it's been
   inserted into when using this option.
 * Added a checkbox for Quicktags (QT) in the admin panel, so Quicktags are
   optional. Speeds up loading of the post editor if you don't need the quicktag
   support, and only use the visual editor. Defaults to off.

= Version 1.3.5 - 9 Apr 2009 =
 * Fixed so the TinyMCE window adds a scrollbar if there is more variables for a
   snippet than fits in the window.
 * Fixed a bug that snippets didn't get inserted when using the visual editor in
   fullscreen mode.

= Version 1.3 - 2 Apr 2009 =
 * Fixed a problem with the regular expressions that prohibited variables
   consisting of just a single number to work.
 * Updated the Help info in the admin page to take less space.
 * Included a check so the plugin only runs in WP 2.7 or newer.

= Version 1.2 - 1 Apr 2009 =
 * Added support for Quicktags so the snippets can be made available in the HTML
   editor as well.

= Version 1.1 - 24 Mar 2009 =
 * Included Swedish translation.
 * Added TextDomain functionality for I18n.
