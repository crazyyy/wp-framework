# Javascript Error Reporting Client

This is a plugin for [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) that collects client-side javascript errors and stores them on the site. 

It's useful for debugging issues that are occasional and difficult to detect based on the description of the error.

## Roadmap
 - Add something in the JS Script to handle if there's a server-side error processing the request
 - Next steps will be to add functionality to only collect data depending on criteria (ie. for logged-in-users only, or for specific js files or error types).
