A developer's inspector to illuminate the WordPress Template Hierarchy and help with building WordPress Classic themes.

== Description ==

A simple, lightweight plugin that displays useful technical information on pages and posts to aid in developing Wordpress Classic themes. Provides quick access to things that are sometimes hidden, like post/page ID, slug, taxonomy terms, and post type slug. Theme Inspector tells you exactly what conditional tags are true on each view, and what template file loaded on each page view. 

* Use In Conjunction with the [WP Template Hierarchy Document](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1hJ0MpHO3HKBT5KsTpGtc_gDYZ5pi-HyxNcRtmPBBULE).
* Theme Inspector is only visible to logged in Administrators.
* Appears on the right-side of the Toolbar (admin bar). 

== Installation ==

1. Simply unzip and upload to the wp-content/plugins' directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. There's nothing to configure. Theme Inspector will automatically appear when you view your website as an Administrator. Look at the upper-right corner of the Toolbar ("Admin Bar").
1. Hover over "Theme Inspector" for a flyout-panel containing information about the page you are currently viewing.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see Theme Inspector! Where is it? =

You must be logged in as an administrator, and viewing the Site (not the admin panel). It will appear on the admin bar.
