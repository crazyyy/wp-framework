Honeypot for Contact Form 7 adds honeypot non-intrusive anti-spam functionality to CF7 forms.

== Description ==

If you are tired of dealing with contact form spam and looking for a simple yet effective solution, then üëá

**Download the ‚ú®Honeypot for Contact Form 7‚ú® plugin right NOW!**

Don't take our word for it; look at our massive community of **400,000+ WordPress users** who trust this anti-spam plugin to prevent Contact Form 7 spam submissions without compromising user experience.

Wait, there is more to it! üòÉüëá

Unlike traditional methods like using CAPTCHA for WordPress Contact Form 7, the honeypot plugin works silently in the background. By adding an invisible honeypot field to your contact form, it catches spam bots without bothering your visitors.
 
Plus, the plugin's submission time check feature further enhances Contact Form 7 spam prevention by blocking bots that submit forms too quickly.

Simply put, with this honeypot contact form solution, you can rest assured that only legitimate submissions reach your inbox.

== What is a Honeypot Trap‚ùî ==

In the context of contact form spam protection, a honeypot trap is a hidden field in your contact form designed to catch spambots. Contrary to humans, bots automatically fill out every field in a form, whether it's visible or not. When a bot fills in the honeypot field, the plugin recognizes it as a spam submission and discards it.

**For example**, in the Honeypot for Contact Form 7, the plugin adds an invisible field to your Contact Form 7 form. Human users will never see this field, but spambots will. When a bot tries to submit the form, it unknowingly fills out this field, triggering the honeypot spam trap. This is how the plugin efficiently filters out unwanted spam without bothering genuine users.


== How does Honeypot for Contact Form 7 work? ==

The concept behind the **Honeypot for Contact Form 7** plugin is simple yet highly effective in preventing **contact form spam**. 

Here‚Äôs a closer look at how the plugin works:

**‚úîÔ∏è Honeypot Field:** The plugin adds an invisible honeypot field to your Contact Form 7 forms. This field is invisible to human visitors but visible to spambots.

**‚úîÔ∏è Spam Detection:** When a bot fills out this invisible honeypot field, the submission is flagged as spam and discarded before it reaches your inbox.

**‚úîÔ∏è Submission Time Check:** Spambots typically submit forms within seconds. The plugin checks how quickly the form is submitted, and if it‚Äôs faster than a user-defined threshold, it‚Äôs marked as spam.

By combining these features, we have created a powerful Contact Form 7 honeypot solution that effectively blocks bots while allowing genuine users to submit their forms seamlessly.

== Privacy Policy ==

We respect the user's data privacy, which is why the Honeypot for Contact Form 7 plugin does not track users, store personal information, or send data to external servers. The plugin does not use cookies and functions solely as an add-on for Contact Form 7.

== Download Legacy/Old Versions ‚Äì If Needed ==

We have designed the latest version of Honeypot for Contact Form 7 to work with the most recent versions of Contact Form 7 and WordPress. However, if you are using older versions, you can access previous versions of this honeypot plugin by clicking "Advanced View" on the plugin's page and scrolling to the bottom.

Although it is possible to use older versions, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest versions of WordPress, Contact Form 7, and the honeypot spam plugin to ensure the best protection against contact form spam.

== Installation ==

1. Install using the Wordpress "Add Plugin" feature -- just search for "Honeypot for Contact Form 7".
1. Confirm that [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) is installed and activated. Then activate this plugin.
1. Edit a form in Contact Form 7.
1. Choose "Honeypot" from the CF7 tag generator. <em>Recommended: change the honeypot element's ID.</em>
1. Insert the generated tag anywhere in your form. The added field uses inline CSS styles to hide the field from your visitors.

= Altering the Honeypot Output HTML [ADVANCED] =
While the basic settings should keep most people happy, we've added several filters for you to further customize the honeypot field. The three filters available are:

* `wpcf7_honeypot_accessibility_message` - Adjusts the default text for the (hidden) accessibility message (**can now be done on the settings page**).
* `wpcf7_honeypot_container_css` - Adjusts the CSS that is applied to the honeypot container to keep it hidden from view.
* `wpcf7_honeypot_html_output` - Adjusts the entire HTML output of the honeypot element.

For examples of the above, please see this [recipe Gist](https://gist.github.com/nocean/953b1362b63bd3ecf68c).


== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Will this module stop all my contact form spam? =

Probably not. But it should reduce it to a level whereby you don't require any additional spam challenges (CAPTCHA, math questions, etc.).

= Are honeypots better than CAPTCHAs? =

This largely depends on the quality of the CAPTCHA. Unfortunately the more difficult a CAPTCHA is to break, the more unfriendly it is to the end user. This honeypot module was created because I don't like CAPTCHAs cluttering up my forms. My recommendation is to try this module first, and if you find that it doesn't stop enough spam, then employ more challenging anti-spam techniques.

= Can I use more than one Honeypot field in my forms? =
You sure can, and many users have indicated this helps stop even more spam, as it increases your chances a bot will get caught in the trap. Just make sure each Honeypot field has a unique name.

= Can I modify the HTML this plugin outputs? =

Yep! See the **Installation** section for more details and [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/nocean/953b1362b63bd3ecf68c) for examples.

= My form is not validating with a W3C validation tool =

As of version 2.0, this shouldn't be the case any longer. However, if it is for some reason, there is a simple work around. See [here](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/w3c-validation-in-1-11-explanation-and-work-arounds/) for details.

= Does this plugin work with Flamingo? =

You bet! If the honeypot trap is triggered, an email isn't sent, but the form submission is added to the **spam** section of Flamingo so you can review what tripped things up.

= Why do you have affiliate ads on your settings page? =

I realize not everyone loves ads, but daddy's gotta pay the bills. I'm extremely grateful to the numerous users that have donated to the plugin's development over the years, and while that's awesome, I don't think donations will ever come remotely close to covering the time and effort it takes to maintain and support a plugin that now has **nearly 1.5 million downloads** and **more than 400,000 active installs**.
