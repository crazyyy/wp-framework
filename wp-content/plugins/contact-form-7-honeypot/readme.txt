== Description ==

**Add extra Spam Protection functionalities to your Contact Form 7 forms with CF7 Apps.**

üí° **[Suggest a Feature](https://cf7apps.com/submit-idea/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=suggest_a_feature)**

And that‚Äôs just the beginning.

üåü **Add a Honeypot Field to Prevent Spam**

Our **Honeypot Contact Form 7 extension** creates a hidden field inside your Contact Form 7 forms. Real users never see it, but bots do‚Äîand that's how the bots fall for the trap. It blocks automated spam before it even hits your inbox.

üåü **Add hCaptcha to Contact Form 7**

Protect your forms from spam bots using **hCaptcha,** a privacy-friendly alternative to Google reCAPTCHA. This extension integrates directly with CF7 and works instantly after setup. No coding is required, and no extra plugins are needed. Just set up your site keys and you're done.

**NOTE:**
The best thing is that both features work independently. You can run them alone or together based on your site‚Äôs needs.

==Real Use Cases for CF7 Apps==

With the CF7 Apps, you can do the following:
  ‚úîÔ∏è Trap bots using a honeypot field without affecting users

= Altering the Honeypot Output HTML [ADVANCED] =
While the basic settings should keep most people happy, we've added several filters for you to further customize the honeypot field. The three filters available are:

* `wpcf7_honeypot_accessibility_message` - Adjusts the default text for the (hidden) accessibility message (**can now be done on the settings page**).
* `wpcf7_honeypot_container_css` - Adjusts the CSS that is applied to the honeypot container to keep it hidden from view.
* `wpcf7_honeypot_html_output` - Adjusts the entire HTML output of the honeypot element.

For examples of the above, please see this [recipe Gist](https://gist.github.com/nocean/953b1362b63bd3ecf68c).
