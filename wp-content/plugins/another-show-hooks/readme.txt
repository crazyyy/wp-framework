Show the origin of an action or filter hook sequentially which helps a developer to debug quickly.

== Description ==

A sequential and visual representation of WordPress action and filter hooks. This is a Developer tool so if you are a developer then it might be a life-saver plugin.

== How? ==

Let's have a question for you! 

Which hook fires first?

1. `admin_init`
2. `init`

A bit confusing, right? `init` runs first and after firing almost 100 hooks `admin_init` runs. Before developing the plugin I had to jump over google or wp handbook which kills my development time and makes my project delayed.

To get rid of this problem, Another Show Hooks present you with a graphical overview right from your web screen.

== Origin ==

We are proud the original base of the plugin was a fork of [Simply Show Hooks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-show-hooks/) as it has not been maintained for the last 6 years and has lots of compatibility issues. We have improved the code security and made it compatible with the latest WordPress.
