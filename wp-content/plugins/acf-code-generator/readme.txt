This plugin is intended to continue the development of the "ACF Theme Code" plugin as there are no updates for that plugin for the last 12 months(for three major WP updates).

Always look into the ACF(Advanced Custom Fields) documentation to get the different types of ACF fields?

Forget the documentation. This tinny WordPress plugin can generate all the code for you so that you don't need to roam here and there to search the code of the ACF plugin.
